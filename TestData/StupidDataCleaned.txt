run legitimate businesses i move for a complete dismissal of this entire case mr flayman im afraid im going to have to consider mr montgomerys motion but you cant we have a terrific case where is your proof where is the evidence show me the smoking gun hold it your honor you want a smoking gun here is your smoking gun what is that its a bee smoker what this this harmless little contraption this

who are you wearing my sweater is ralph lauren and i have no pants what if montgomerys right what do you mean weve been living the bee way a long time  million years congratulations on your victory what will you demand as a settlement first well demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with every last drop we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly badbreath stink machine were all aware of what they do in the woods wait for my signal take him out hell have nauseous for a few hours

wilting doesnt look very good does it no and whose fault do you think that is you know im gonna guess bees bees specifically me i didnt think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things its not just flowers fruits vegetables they all need bees thats our whole sat test right there take away produce that affects the entire animal kingdom and then of course the human species so

the shield door drops away and obiwan crashes on the deck of the hangar bay engulfed in a fantail of sparks a set of blast doors starts slamming shut across the hangar opening as material is sucked into space  anakin maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors slam shut obiwan ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit he jumps dear just as his ship explodes battle droids rush at him from all directions  anakin jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the battle droids to where obiwan is fighting artoo pops out of the ship and follows anakin  obiwan artoo locate the chancellor  anakin tap into the ships computers  they cut down the last of the droids and follow artoo over to a computer wall socket the two jedi fight off

int generator roomtrade federation cruiser  the two jedi cut their way down several floors into a large generator room huge explosions outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break and fluid is spewing everywhere the jedi get up and turn off their light sabers anakin dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it  obiwan    fuel the slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion thats why theyve stopped shooting  anakin well then were safe for the time being  obiwan your idea of safe is not the same as mine  they run explosions rattle the ship and pipes continue to burst around them spilling more fuel into the hallway at the far end six super battle droids drop into the fuel the sounds of shield doors closing and locking echo throughout the hallway they pass several large power generators which are topped with sparking excess power dischargers  anakin theyre sealing this section off  obiwan six droids coming our way  the last of the doors can be heard closing in the distance  anakin keep moving there must be vents    this way  they move along a wall anakin climbs up the side to a small vent the fuel gets closer to the sparking dischargers  obiwan well never get through that its too small  they move toward a second vent obiwan is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling anakin feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent he closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening then he moves on obiwan is forced into handtohand combat with one of the super battle droids it pulls the jedi under the fuel just before he is about to drown obiwan disables the super battle droid by pushing him into an exhaust pipe  the fuel is up to the jedis chins anakin finds a very very small metal grate then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose  anakin i found our escape vent  obiwan anakin this is no time for jokes were in serious trouble here  anakin only in your mind my master look no structure     anakin grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank ripping a large panel loose revealing a mansized work shaft they scramble through it as the droids swim closer   int vent shafttrade federation cruiser  the two jedi pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube  anakin heres a way out  as the super battle droids reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks the jedi work the keyboard on the pressure lock opening the latch   int small passagewaytrade federation cruiser  the two jedi climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut they make their way through the evershrinking shaft until they reach the end   int hallwaytrade federation cruiser  a hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the trade federation cruiser and the jedi squeeze out slamming the hatch behind them anakin seals the hatch with his laser sword  obiwan that wont hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers  anakin the blast will break the hull this sides pressurized  obiwan you still have much to learn anakin   int vent shafttrade federation cruiser  the super battle droids climb up the vent shaft super battle droid r and several other droids wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger  super battle droid r i have a bad feeling about this   int generator roomtrade federation cruiser  the fuel hits the sparking power discharger and there is a huge explosion   ext trade federation cruiserbattle  a great explosion and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the federation cruiser   int hallwaytrade federation cruiser  a large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the explosion hits obiwan jumps back then stands amazed  obiwan all right you win i have much to learn lets go  anakin grins at obiwan and they run down the hallway   int wide hallwaytrade federation cruiser  the two jedi wait for an elevator to arrive they turn around and see they are face to face with three destroyer droids the droids start blasting away anakin deflects the bolts obiwan frantically pushes the elevator button several more times  anakin destroyers  finally the door opens and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts the elevator door slides shut the jedi turn to see battle droids standing behind them  battle droid drop your weapons i said drop em  the jedi activate their light sabers and destroy all the battle droids   int hangartrade federation cruiser

reply   int main hangartrade federation cruiser  artoo tries to muffle the comlink as the two super battle droids try to figure out where the voices are coming from artoo extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface  obiwan os artoo switch on the comlink artoo do you hear me artoo we gave you a job to do artoo   int elevator shafttrade federation cruiser  suddenly the elevator plummets down the shaft anakin quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door he watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears anakin struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as sparking wires rain down on him   int elevatortrade federation cruiser  the elevator starts to descend rapidly  obiwan stop stop artoo we need to be going up   int elevator shafttrade federation cruiser  anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft the door to the elevator shaft is pried open and two battle droids appear in the doorway and look down at anakin they point their

you stupid little astro droid   int elevator shafttrade federation cruiser  anakin looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed he looks at the battle droids leaning over him with their guns pointed at him he calculates for a moment then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft  before anakin can arc into a descent down the shaft the elevator races up through the shaft cutting the droids in two anakin lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling obiwan is startled and ignites his lightsaber  obiwan oh its you      int main hangartrade federation cruiser  artoo activates his oil hose and sprays the super battle droids the super battle droids slip on the oil   int elevator shafttrade federation

vertical shaft to move into a fortyfivedegree angle they hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them  anakinn hold on  obiwan what is that  obiwan and anakin look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed then obiwan turns to anakin  obiwan continuing oops  anakin artoo artoo shut down the elevator  obiwan too late jump  they fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator the shaft continues to rotate until it is

down a hallway toward the hangar bay   int doorway to hangar baytrade federation cruiser  it is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space the hangar bay doors are closed but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists reentering the atmosphere of coruscant they stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay  obiwan none of those ships will get us anywhere  anakin i agree  palpatine what are we going to do  anakin i dont know  obiwan dont look at me i dont know  anakin and palpatine both look to obiwan he shrugs his shoulders anakins fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled suddenly the ship turns on its side  anakin here chancellor lock this around your waist and hold on  obiwan well head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod  anakin hands palpatine the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt palpatine attaches it around his waist anakin and obiwan throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes   int main hangartrade federation cruiser  obiwan grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall as he moves out into the hangar two super battle droids start firing at him the jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the droids blowing them up anakin and palpatine follow obiwan along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar palpatine struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar palpatine loses his grip as a pipe breaks causing a rush of steam but anakin manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the chancellor dangles on the other end of the utility cable they are surrounded by sparks and explosions as the ship twists and tries to break apart anakin moves out of the steam and struggles to pull palpatine back to safety anakin is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds the ceiling behind them buckles causing pipes to break creating geysers of steam some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space they make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them   int hangar doorwaytrade federation cruiser  obiwan anakin and palpatine are out

breath to express his total disappointment  obiwan wait a minute howd this happen were smarter than this  anakin apparently not master this is the oldest trap in the book    well  i was distracted  obiwan oh so all of a sudden its my fault  anakin youre the master im just a hero  obiwan im open to suggestions here  palpatine why dont we let them take us to general grievous perhaps with count

and hell release the ray shields     artoo comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall he takes a moment to compose himself  anakin continuing see no problem  suddenly several doorways open revealing two destroyer droids sixteen super battle droids emerge from behind the destroyer droids artoo turns and zaps one of the super battle droids who then kicks artoo over  super

make a fine addition to my collection  obiwan not this time and this time you wont escape  anakin artoo  artoo creates a distraction by extending all his arms shooting out electrical pulses and bouncing around obiwan hands restrained with electrobonds spins around reaches out and using the force yanks his lightsaber out of the generals hand ignites it and cuts his bonds he continues to spin around and cuts anakin free  general grievous crush them make them suffer  anakin uses the force to yank his lightsaber out of the generals hand  the droids that surround them begin to fire obiwan and anakin jump into the line of fire the bridge degenerates into chaos obiwan and anakin are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with general grievouss two bodyguards  chancellor palpatine is taken away by two battle droids general grievous walks around the bridge directing the battle droids  general grievous stay and watch your stations  obiwan fights one of general grievouss bodyguards the bodyguard carries an electrified staff about five feet long when the laser sword hits it electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword obiwan is unable to cut the staff the jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge obiwan pulls himself together and attacks again cutting off the droid bodyguards head the droid bodyguard keeps attacking anakin struggles to defend himself against the other manic droid bodyguard he cuts the droid bodyguard in half two battle droids try to take the chancellor away anakin follows them down the hallway and cuts them down rescuing the chancellor obiwan finishes off the headless bodyguard it crumbles to the floor in pieces alarms sound as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit a pilot yells at general grievous  pilot sir we are falling out of orbit all aft control cells are dead  general grievous stay on course    dont bother with them keep the

general grievous you lose general kenobi  one of the pilots stands next to the general  pilot the ship is breaking up  general grievous weve run out of time  obiwan tries to get at general grievous anakin runs at the general from the opposing side general grievous turns and throws his electrified staff at the window it breaks causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space general grievous is the first one sucked out into space he fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship he swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship obiwan anakin and palpatine hold on for dear life a blast shield closes around where the window used to be   int bridgetrade federation cruiser  obiwan continues to fight the battle droids the droids have backed him into a corner obiwan hides behind a control panel as the droids blast away at him he jumps up and over the droids cutting most of them down before he lands he destroys the droids and joins anakin anakin and obiwan cut through the rest of the droids as if they were made of butter palpatine stands in shock as he watches the carnage droid parts are firing everywhere obiwan and anakin stand back to back and cut down the last of the droids just as there is a huge shudder followed by more alarms sparks begin to fly outside the windows  palpatine the hull is burning up   ext hulltrade federation

not forget that you rescued me from the buzz droids and you killed count dooku and you rescued the chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely     anakin all because of your training master you deserve all those speeches of your greatness  obiwan    the endless speeches    anakin lets be fair today you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians  anakin all right but you owe me    and not for saving your skin for the tenth time     obiwan ninth time    that business on cato nemoidia doesnt count ill see you

to your two jedi knights they killed count dooku but general grievous has escaped once again  mace wlndu general grievous will run and hide as he always does he is a coward  palpatine that maybe true but with count dooku dead he is the leader of the droid army and i assure you the senate will vote to continue the war as long as grievous is alive  mace wlndu then the jedi council will make finding grievous our highest priority  bail anakin and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the senate building grand hallway  bail organa skywalker the republic cannot praise you enough  anakin and

wrong then  obiwan the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today  anakin well that can only mean less deliberating and more action is that bad it will make it easier for us to end this war  obiwan anakin be careful of your friend palpatine  anakin be careful of what  obiwan he has requested your presence  anakin what for  obiwan he would not say  anakin he didnt inform the jedi council thats unusual isnt it  obiwan all of this is unusual and its making me feel uneasy youre probably aware that relations between the council and the chancellor are stressed  anakin i know the council has grown wary of the chancellors power mine also for that matter arent we all working together to save the republic why all this distrust  obiwan the force grows dark anakin and we are all affected by it be wary of your feelings   int coruscantchancellors officeday  anakin stands with palpatine at his window overlooking the vastness of coruscant several buildings have

report to the senate  palpatine they will report to me    personally the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war this will bring a quick end to things  anakin i agree but the jedi council may not see it that way  palpatine there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security  anakin with all due respect sir the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments  palpatine thank you my friend but in this case i have no choice    this war must be won  anakin everyone will agree on that  palpatine anakin ive known you since you were a small boy i have advised you over the years when i could  i am very proud of your accomplishments you have won many battles the jedi council thought were lost    and you saved my life i hope you trust me anakin  anakin of course  palpatine i need your help son  anakin what do you mean  palpatine i fear the jedi the council keeps pushing for more control theyre shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy    ideals i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy  anakin i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic sir  palpatine nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words im depending on you  anakin for what i dont understand  palpatine to be the eyes ears and voice of the republic     anakin thinks about this  palpatine continuing anakin    im appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council  anakin me a master i am overwhelmed sir but the council elects its own members they will never accept this

the outlying systems you must sweep  obiwan it may take some time    we do not have many ships to spare  mace we cannot take ships from the front line  obiwan and yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup  yoda master kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait  kladimundi what about the droid attack on the wookiees  mace it is critical we send an attack group there immediately  obiwan hes right that is a system we cannot afford to lose its the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant  anakin i know that system well it would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet  mace skywalker your assignment is here with the chancellor and kenobi must find general grievous  yoda go i will good relations with the wookiees i have  mace it is

thats never been done in the history of the jedi its insulting  obiwan calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age    its never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is youre too close to the chancellor the council doesnt like it when he interferes in jedi affairs  anakin i swear to you i didnt ask to be put on the council     obiwan but its what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off  anakin that has nothing to do with this  obiwan anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation  anakin you mean divided loyalties  obiwan i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor i was very clear why didnt you listen you walked right into it  anakin the council is upset im the youngest to ever serve  obiwan no it is not anakin i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride those are not jedi thoughts theyre dangerous dark thoughts  anakin master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities i know where my loyalties lie  obiwan i hope so     anakin i sense theres more to this talk than youre saying  obiwan anakin the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you  anakin and  obiwan anakin look i am on your side i didnt want to see you put in this situation  anakin what situation  obiwan takes a deep breath the council wants you to report on all of the chancellors dealings they want to know what hes up to  anakin they want me to spy on the chancellor thats treason  obiwan we are at war anakin the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic even if the chancellor does not  anakin why didnt the council give me this assignment when we were in session  obiwan this assignment is not to be on record the council asked me to approach you on this personally  anakin the chancellor is not a bad man obiwan he befriended me hes watched out for me ever since i arrived here  obiwan that is why you must help us anakin our allegiance is to the senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired  anakin master the senate demanded that he stay longer  obiwan yes but use your feelings anakin something is out of place  anakin youre asking me to do something against the jedi code against the republic against a mentor    and a friend thats whats out of place here why are you asking this of me  obiwan the council is asking you   ext coruscantclone landing platformday  a jedi gunship heads for the huge clone

of the republic  padme have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side  anakin suspicious what do you mean  padme what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy  anakin i dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist  padme anakin this war represents a failure to listen    now youre closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume  anakin growing angry dont ask me to do that padme make a motion in the senate where that kind of a request belongs im not your errand boy im not anyones errand boy  padme what is it  anakin nothing  padme dont do this    dont shut me out let me help you  anakin you cant help me    im trying to

clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous he is hiding in the utapau system  anakin at last well be able to capture that monster and end this war  palpatine i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didnt select you for this assignment you are the best choice by far  but they cant always be trusted to do the right thing  anakin they try  palpatine sit down to his aides leave us  anakin sits next to palpatine the chancellor leans over to him  palpatine continuing anakin you know im not able to rely on the jedi council if they havent included you in their plot they soon will  anakin im not sure i understand  palpatine you must sense what i have come to suspect    the jedi council want control of the republic    theyre planning to betray me  anakin i dont think     palpatine anakin search your feelings you know dont you  anakin i know they dont trust you     palpatine or the senate    or the republic    or democracy for that matter  anakin i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken  palpatine why they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didnt they  anakin doesnt say anything he simply looks down  palpatine continuing they asked you to spy on me didnt they  anakin i dont know  i dont know what to say  palpatine remember back to your early teachings anakin all those who gain power are afraid to lose it even the jedi  anakin the jedi use their power for good  palpatine good is a point of view anakin and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the jedi to be    anakin    evil  palpatine    from a jedis point of view the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force that is why they are more powerful  anakin the sith rely on their passion for their strength they think inward only about themselves  palpatine and the jedi dont  anakin the jedi are selfless    they only care about others  palpatine smiles  palpatine or so youve been trained to believe why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong  anakin im not sure its wrong  palpatine have they asked you to betray the jedi code the constitution a friendship your own values think consider their motives keep your mind clear of assumptions the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith  anakin is deep in thought  palpatine continuing did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise  anakin no  palpatine i thought not its not a story the jedi would tell you its a sith legend darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying  anakin he could actually save people from death  palpatine the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural  anakin what happened to him  palpatine he became so powerful    the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep smiles plagueis never saw it coming its ironic he could save others from death but not himself  anakin is it possible to learn this power  palpatine not from a jedi   ext kashyyykday  a wookiee

introduction the manifesto of the communist party was written by marx and engels as the communist leagues programme on the instruction of its second congress london november december   which signified a victory for the followers of a new proletarian line during the discussion of the programme questions when congress was still in preparation marx and engels arrived at the conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a party manifesto see engels letter to marx of november   the catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and retained in the draft of a communist confession of faith and principles of communism was not suitable for a full and substantial exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook for a comprehensive formulation of the proletarian movements aims and tasks see also demands of the communist party in germany issued by marx soon after publication of the manifesto which addressed the immediate demands of the movement marx and engels began working together on the manifesto while they were still in london immediately after the congress and continued until about december  when marx returned to brussels they resumed their work four days later december  when engels arrived there after engels departure for paris at the end of december and up to his return on january  marx worked on the manifesto alone hurried by the central authority of the communist league which provided him with certain documents eg addresses of the peoples chamber halle of the league of the just of november  and february  and apparently documents of the first congress of the communist league pertaining to the discussion of the party programme marx worked intensively on the manifesto through almost the whole of january  at the end of january the manuscript was sent on to london to be printed in the german workers educational societys print shop owned by a german emigrant j e burghard a member of the communist league the manuscript of the manifesto has not survived the only extant materials written in marxs hand are a draft plan for section iii showing his efforts to improve the structure of the manifesto and a page of a rough copy the manifesto came off the press at the end of february  on february  the educational society decided to cover all the printing expenses the first edition of the manifesto was a page pamphlet in a dark green cover in aprilmay  another edition was put out the text took up  pages some misprints of the first edition were corrected and the punctuation improved subsequently this text was used by marx and engels as a basis for later authorised editions between march and july  the manifesto was printed in the deutsche londoner zeitung a democratic newspaper of the german emigrants already that same year numerous efforts were made to publish the manifesto in other european languages a danish a polish in paris and a swedish under a different title the voice of communism declaration of the communist party editions appeared in  the translations into french italian and spanish made at that time remained unpublished in april  engels then in barmen was translating the manifesto into english but he managed to translate only half of it and the first english translation made by helen macfarlane was not published until two years later between june and november  in the chartist journal the red republican its editor julian harney named the authors for the first time in the introduction to this publication all earlier and many subsequent editions of the manifesto were anonymous the growing emancipation struggle of the proletariat in the s and s of the th century led to new editions of the manifesto the year  saw a new german edition with minor corrections and a preface by marx and engels where they drew some conclusions from the experience of the paris  introduction commune of  this and subsequent german editions  and  were entitled the communist manifesto in  the manifesto was first published in america in woodhull  claflins weekly the first russian edition of the manifesto translated by mikhail bakunin with some distortions appeared in geneva in  the faults of this edition were removed in the  edition translation by georgi plekhanov for which marx and engels who attributed great significance to the dissemination of marxism in russia had written a special preface after marxs death the manifesto ran into several editions engels read through them all wrote prefaces for the  german edition and for the  english edition in samuel moores translation which he also edited and supplied with notes this edition served as a basis for many subsequent editions of the manifesto in english  in britain the united states and the ussr in  engels prepared a further german edition wrote a new preface to it and added a number of notes in  the newspaper le socialiste published the french translation of the manifesto made by marxs daughter laura lafargue and read by engels he also wrote prefaces to the  polish and  italian editions this edition includes the two earlier versions of the manifesto namely the draft communist confession of faith and the principles of communism both authored by engels as well as the letter from engels to marx which poses the idea of publishing a manifesto rather than a catechism the manifesto addressed itself to a mass movement with historical significance not a political sect on the other hand the demands of the communist party in germany is included to place the publication of the manifesto in the context of the mass movement in germany at the time whose immediate demands are reflected by marx in this pamphlet clearly the aims of the manifesto were more farreaching the movement in germany at the time and unlike the demands was intended to outlive the immediate conditions the third address to the international workingmens association is included because in this speech marx examines the movement of the working class manifested in the paris commune and his observations here mark the only revisions to his social and historical vision made during his lifetime as a result of the development of the working class movement itself clarifying some points and making others more concrete preface to the  german edition the communist league an international association of workers which could of course be only a secret one under conditions obtaining at the time commissioned us the undersigned at the congress held in london in november  to write for publication a detailed theoretical and practical programme for the party such was the origin of the following manifesto the manuscript of which travelled to london to be printed a few weeks before the february french revolution in  first published in german it has been republished in that language in at least twelve different editions in germany england and america it was published in english for the first time in  in the red republican london translated by miss helen macfarlane and in  in at least three different translations in america the french version first appeared in paris shortly before the june insurrection of  and recently in le socialiste of new york a new translation is in the course of preparation a polish version appeared in london shortly after it was first published in germany a russian translation was published in geneva in the sixties  into danish too it was translated shortly after its appearance however much that state of things may have altered during the last twentyfive years the general principles laid down in the manifesto are on the whole as correct today as ever here and there some detail might be improved the practical application of the principles will depend as the manifesto itself states everywhere and at all times on the historical conditions for the time being existing and for that reason no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of section ii that passage would in many respects be very differently worded today in view of the gigantic strides of modern industry since  and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class in view of the practical experience gained first in the february revolution and then still more in the paris commune where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months this programme has in some details been antiquated one thing especially was proved by the commune viz that the working class cannot simply lay hold of the readymade state machinery and wield it for its own purposes see the civil war in france address of the general council of the international working mens association  where this point is further developed further it is selfevident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time because it comes down only to  also that the remarks on the relation of the communists to the various opposition parties section iv although in principle still correct yet in practice are antiquated because the political situation has been entirely changed and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated but then the manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter a subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from  to the present day but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that karl marx  frederick engels june   london preface to the  russian edition the first russian edition of the manifesto of the communist party translated by bakunin was published early in the sixties by the printing office of the kolokol a reference to the free russian printing house then the west could see in it the russian edition of the manifesto only a literary curiosity such a view would be impossible today what a limited field the proletarian movement occupied at that time december  is most clearly shown by the last section the position of the communists in relation to the various opposition parties in various countries precisely russia and the united states are missing here it was the time when russia constituted the last great reserve of all european reaction when the united states absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of europe through immigration both countries provided europe with raw materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial products both were therefore in one way of another pillars of the existing european system how very different today precisely european immigration fitted north american for a gigantic agricultural production whose competition is shaking the very foundations of european landed property  large and small at the same time it enabled the united states to exploit its tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break the industrial monopoly of western europe and especially of england existing up to now both circumstances react in a revolutionary manner upon america itself step by step the small and middle land ownership of the farmers the basis of the whole political constitution is succumbing to the competition of giant farms at the same time a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capital funds are developing for the first time in the industrial regions and now russia during the revolution of  not only the european princes but the european bourgeois as well found their only salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in russian intervention the tsar was proclaimed the chief of european reaction today he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in gatchina   and russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in europe the communist manifesto had as its object the proclamation of the inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property but in russia we find facetoface with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle and bourgeois property just beginning to develop more than half the land owned in common by the peasants now the question is can the russian obshchina though greatly undermined yet a form of primeval common ownership of land pass directly to the higher form of communist common ownership or on the contrary must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the west the only answer to that possible today is this if the russian revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the west so that both complement each other the present russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development karl marx  frederick engels january   london preface to the  german edition the preface to the present edition i must alas sign alone marx the man to whom the whole working class of europe and america owes more than to any one else  rests at highgate cemetery and over his grave the first grass is already growing since his death march   there can be even less thought of revising or supplementing the manifesto but i consider it all the more necessary again to state the following expressly the basic thought running through the manifesto  that economic production and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch that consequently ever since the dissolution of the primaeval communal ownership of land all history has been a history of class struggles of struggles between exploited and exploiting between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social evolution that this struggle however has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class the proletariat can no longer emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it the bourgeoisie without at the same time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation oppression class struggles  this basic thought belongs solely and exclusively to marx i have already stated this many times but precisely now is it necessary that it also stand in front of the manifesto itself frederick engels june   london   this proposition i wrote in the preface to the english translation which in my opinion is destined to do for history what darwin s theory has done for biology we both of us had been gradually approaching for some years before  how far i had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my conditions of the working class in england but when i again met marx at brussels in spring  he had it already worked out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which i have stated it here note by engels to the german edition of  preface to the  english edition the manifesto was published as the platform of the communist league a working men s association first exclusively german later on international and under the political conditions of the continent before  unavoidably a secret society at a congress of the league held in november  marx and engels were commissioned to prepare a complete theoretical and practical party programme drawn up in german in january  the manuscript was sent to the printer in london a few weeks before the french revolution of february  a french translation was brought out in paris shortly before the insurrection of june  the first english translation by miss helen macfarlane appeared in george julian harney s red republican london  a danish and a polish edition had also been published the defeat of the parisian insurrection of june   the first great battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie  drove again into the background for a time the social and political aspirations of the european working class thenceforth the struggle for supremacy was again as it had been before the revolution of february solely between different sections of the propertied class the working class was reduced to a fight for political elbowroom and to the position of extreme wing of the middleclass radicals wherever independent proletarian movements continued to show signs of life they were ruthlessly hunted down thus the prussian police hunted out the central board of the communist league then located in cologne the members were arrested and after eighteen months imprisonment they were tried in october  this celebrated cologne communist trial lasted from october  till november  seven of the prisoners were sentenced to terms of imprisonment in a fortress varying from three to six years immediately after the sentence the league was formally dissolved by the remaining members as to the manifesto it seemed henceforth doomed to oblivion when the european workers had recovered sufficient strength for another attack on the ruling classes the international working men s association sprang up but this association formed with the express aim of welding into one body the whole militant proletariat of europe and america could not at once proclaim the principles laid down in the manifesto the international was bound to have a programme broad enough to be acceptable to the english trade unions to the followers of proudhon in france belgium italy and spain and to the lassalleans in germany marx who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class which was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion the very events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital the defeats even more than the victories could not help bringing home to men s minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums and preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions for workingclass emancipation and marx was right the international on its breaking in  left the workers quite different men from what it found them in  proudhonism in france lassalleanism in germany were dying out and even the conservative english trade unions though most of them had long since severed their connection with the international were gradually advancing towards that point at which last year at swansea their president w bevan could say in their name continental socialism has lost its terror for us in fact the principles of the manifesto had made considerable headway among the working men of all countries   lassalle personally to us always acknowledged himself to be a disciple of marx and as such stood on the ground of the manifesto but in his first public agitation  he did not go beyond demanding cooperative workshops supported by state credit  preface to the  english edition the manifesto itself came thus to the front again since  the german text had been reprinted several times in switzerland england and america in  it was translated into english in new york where the translation was published in woorhull and claflins weekly from this english version a french one was made in le socialiste of new york since then at least two more english translations more or less mutilated have been brought out in america and one of them has been reprinted in england the first russian translation made by bakunin was published at herzen s kolokol office in geneva about  a second one by the heroic vera zasulich also in geneva in  a new danish edition is to be found in socialdemokratisk bibliothek copenhagen  a fresh french translation in le socialiste paris  from this latter a spanish version was prepared and published in madrid  the german reprints are not to be counted there have been twelve altogether at the least an armenian translation which was to be published in constantinople some months ago did not see the light i am told because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name of marx on it while the translator declined to call it his own production of further translations into other languages i have heard but had not seen thus the history of the manifesto reflects the history of the modern workingclass movement at present it is doubtless the most wide spread the most international production of all socialist literature the common platform acknowledged by millions of working men from siberia to california yet when it was written we could not have called it a socialist manifesto by socialists in  were understood on the one hand the adherents of the various utopian systems owenites in england fourierists in france both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects and gradually dying out on the other hand the most multifarious social quacks who by all manner of tinkering professed to redress without any danger to capital and profit all sorts of social grievances in both cases men outside the workingclass movement and looking rather to the educated classes for support whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change called itself communist it was a crude roughhewn purely instinctive sort of communism still it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the utopian communism of cabet in france and of weitling in germany thus in  socialism was a middleclass movement communism a workingclass movement socialism was on the continent at least respectable communism was the very opposite and as our notion from the very beginning was that the emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take moreover we have ever since been far from repudiating it the manifesto being our joint production i consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs to marx that proposition is that in every historical epoch the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange and the social organization necessarily following from it form the basis upon which it is built up and from that which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch that consequently the whole history of mankind since the dissolution of primitive tribal society holding land in common ownership has been a history of class struggles contests between exploiting and exploited ruling and oppressed classes that the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolutions in which nowadays a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class  the proletariat  cannot attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class  the bourgeoisie  without at the same time and once and for all emancipating society at large from all exploitation oppression class distinction and class struggles this proposition which in my opinion is destined to do for history what darwin s theory has done for biology we both of us had been gradually approaching for some years before  how far i had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my conditions of the working class in england but when i again met marx at brussels in spring  he had it  preface to the  english edition already worked out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which i have stated it here from our joint preface to the german edition of  i quote the following however much that state of things may have altered during the last twentyfive years the general principles laid down in the manifesto are on the whole as correct today as ever here and there some detail might be improved the practical application of the principles will depend as the manifesto itself states everywhere and at all times on the historical conditions for

are antiquated because the political situation has been entirely changed and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated but then the manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter the present translation is by mr samuel moore the translator of the greater portion of marx s capital we have revised it in common and i have added a few notes explanatory of historical allusions frederick engels january   london preface to the  german edition since the first german preface of  was written a new german edition of the manifesto has again become necessary and much has also happened to the manifesto which should be recorded here a second russian translation  by vera zasulich  appeared in geneva in  the preface to that edition was written by marx and myself unfortunately the original german manuscript has gone astray i must therefore retranslate from the russian which will in no way improve the text it reads reprint of the  russian edition  at about the same date a new polish version appeared in geneva manifest kommunistyczny furthermore a new danish translation has appeared in the socialdemokratisk bibliothek copenhagen  unfortunately it is not quite complete certain essential passages which seem to have presented difficulties to the translator have been omitted and in addition there are signs of carelessness here and there which are all the more unpleasantly conspicuous since the translation indicates that had the translator taken a little more pains he would have done an excellent piece of work a new french version appeared in  in le socialiste of paris it is the best published to date from this latter a spanish version was published the same year in el socialista of madrid and then reissued in pamphlet form manifesto del partido communista por carlos marx y f engels madrid administracion de el socialista hernan cortes  as a matter of curiosity i may mention that in  the manuscript of an armenian translation was offered to a publisher in constantinople but the good man did not have the courage to publish something bearing the name of marx and suggested that the translator set down his own name as author which the latter however declined after one and then another of the more or less inaccurate american translations had been repeatedly reprinted in england an authentic version at last appeared in  this was my friend samuel moore and we went through it together once more before it went to press it is entitled manifesto of the communist party by karl marx and frederick engels authorized english translation edited and annotated by frederick engels  london william reeves  fleet street ec i have added some of the notes of that edition to the present one the manifesto has had a history of its own greeted with enthusiasm at the time of its appearance by the not at all numerous vanguard of scientific socialism as is proved by the translations mentioned in the first place it was soon forced into the background by the reaction that began with the defeat of the paris workers in june  and was finally excommunicated by law in the conviction of the cologne communists in november  with the disappearance from the public scene of the workers movement that had begun with the february revolution the manifesto too passed into the background when the european workers had again gathered sufficient strength for a new onslaught upon the power of the ruling classes the international working men s association came into being its aim was to weld together into one huge army the whole militant working class of europe and america therefore it could not set out from the principles laid down in the manifesto it was bound to have a programme which would not shut the door on the english trade unions the french belgian italian and spanish proudhonists and the german lassalleans this programme  the considerations underlying the statutes of the international  was drawn up by marx with a master hand acknowledged even by the bakunin and the anarchists for the ultimate final triumph  preface to the  german edition of the ideas set forth in the manifesto marx relied solely upon the intellectual development of the working class as it necessarily has to ensue from united action and discussion the events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital the defeats even more than the successes could not but demonstrate to the fighters the inadequacy of their former universal panaceas and make their minds more receptive to a thorough understanding of the true conditions for workingclass emancipation and marx was right the working class of  at the dissolution of the international was altogether different from that of  at its foundation proudhonism in the latin countries and the specific lassalleanism in germany were dying out and even the ten archconservative english trade unions were gradually approaching the point where in  the chairman of their swansea congress could say in their name continental socialism has lost its terror for us yet by  continental socialism was almost exclusively the theory heralded in the manifesto thus to a certain extent the history of the manifesto reflects the history of the modern workingclass movement since  at present it is doubtless the most widely circulated the most international product of all socialist literature the common programme of many millions of workers of all countries from siberia to california nevertheless when it appeared we could not have called it a socialist manifesto in  two kinds of people were considered socialists on the one hand were the adherents of the various utopian systems notably the owenites in england and the fourierists in france both of whom at that date had already dwindled to mere sects gradually dying out on the other the manifold types of social quacks who wanted to eliminate social abuses through their various universal panaceas and all kinds of patchwork without hurting capital and profit in the least in both cases people who stood outside the labor movement and who looked for support rather to the educated classes the section of the working class however which demanded a radical reconstruction of society convinced that mere political revolutions were not enough then called itself communist it was still a roughhewn only instinctive and frequently somewhat crude communism yet it was powerful enough to bring into being two systems of utopian communism  in france the icarian communists of cabet and in germany that of weitling socialism in  signified a bourgeois movement communism a workingclass movement socialism was on the continent at least quite respectable whereas communism was the very opposite and since we were very decidedly of the opinion as early as then that the emancipation of the workers must be the task of the working class itself from the general rules of the international we could have no hesitation as to which of the two names we should choose nor has it ever occurred to us to repudiate it working men of all countries unite but few voices responded when we proclaimed these words to the world  years ago on the eve of the first paris revolution in which the proletariat came out with the demands of its own on september   however the proletarians of most of the western european countries joined hands in the international working men s association of glorious memory true the international itself lived only nine years but that the eternal union of the proletarians of all countries created by it is still alive and lives stronger than ever there is no better witness than this day because today  as i write these lines the european and american proletariat is reviewing its fighting forces mobilized for the first time mobilized as one army under one flag for one immediate aim the standard eighthour working day to be established by legal enactment as proclaimed by the geneva congress of the international in  and again by the paris workers congress of  and today s spectacle will open the eyes of the capitalists and landlords of all countries to the fact that today the proletarians of all countries are united indeed if only marx were still by my side to see this with his own eyes frederick engels may   london preface to the  polish edition the fact that a new polish edition of the communist manifesto has become necessary gives rise to various thoughts first of all it is noteworthy that of late the manifesto has become an index as it were of the development of largescale industry on the european continent in proportion as largescale industry expands in a given country the demand grows among the workers of that country for enlightenment regarding their position as the working class in relation to the possessing classes the socialist movement spreads among them and the demand for the manifesto increases thus not only the state of the labour movement but also the degree of development of largescale industry can be measured with fair accuracy in every country by the number of copies of the manifesto circulated in the language of that country accordingly the new polish edition indicates a decided progress of polish industry and there can be no doubt whatever that this progress since the previous edition published ten years ago has actually taken place russian poland congress poland has become the big industrial region of the russian empire whereas russian largescale industry is scattered sporadically  a part round the gulf of finland another in the centre moscow and vladimir a third along the coasts of the black and azov seas and still others elsewhere  polish industry has been packed into a relatively small area and enjoys both the advantages and disadvantages arising from such concentration the competing russian manufacturers acknowledged the advantages when they demanded protective tariffs against poland in spit of their ardent desire to transform the poles into russians the disadvantages  for the polish manufacturers and the russian government  are manifest in the rapid spread of socialist ideas among the polish workers and in the growing demand for the manifesto but the rapid development of polish industry outstripping that of russia is in its turn a new proof of the inexhaustible vitality of the polish people and a new guarantee of its impending national restoration and the restoration of an independent and strong poland is a matter which concerns not only the poles but all of us a sincere international collaboration of the european nations is possible only if each of these nations is fully autonomous in its own house the revolution of  which under the banner of the proletariat after all merely let the proletarian fighters do the work of the bourgeoisie also secured the independence of italy germany and hungary through its testamentary executors louis bonaparte and bismarck but poland which since  had done more for the revolution than all these three together was left to its own resources when it succumbed in  to a tenfold greater russian force the nobility could neither maintain nor regain polish independence today to the bourgeoisie this independence is to say the last immaterial nevertheless it is a necessity for the harmonious collaboration of the european nations it can be gained only by the young polish proletariat and in its hands it is secure for the workers of all the rest of europe need the independence of poland just as much as the polish workers themselves f engels london february   preface to the  italian edition publication of the manifesto of the communist party coincided one may say with march   the day of the revolution in milan and berlin which were armed uprisings of the two nations situated in the centre the one of the continent of europe the other of the mediterranean two nations until then enfeebled by division and internal strife and thus fallen under foreign domination while italy was subject to the emperor of austria germany underwent the yoke not less effective though more indirect of the tsar of all the russias the consequences of march   freed both italy and germany from this disgrace if from  to  these two great nations were reconstituted and somehow again put on their own it was as karl marx used to say because the men who suppressed the revolution of  were nevertheless its testamentary executors in spite of themselves everywhere that revolution was the work of the working class it was the latter that built the barricades and paid with its lifeblood only the paris workers in overthrowing the government had the very definite intention of overthrowing the bourgeois regime but conscious though they were of the fatal antagonism existing between their own class and the bourgeoisie still neither the economic progress of the country nor the intellectual development of the mass of french workers had as yet reached the stage which would have made a social reconstruction possible in the final analysis therefore the fruits of the revolution were reaped by the capitalist class in the other countries in italy in germany in austria the workers from the very outset did nothing but raise the bourgeoisie to power but in any country the rule of the bourgeoisie is impossible without national independence therefore the revolution of  had to bring in its train the unity and autonomy of the nations that had lacked them up to then italy germany hungary poland will follow in turn thus if the revolution of  was not a socialist revolution it paved the way prepared the ground for the latter through the impetus given to largescaled industry in all countries the bourgeois regime during the last fortyfive years has everywhere created a numerous concentrated and powerful proletariat it has thus raised to use the language of the manifesto its own gravediggers without restoring autonomy and unity to each nation it will be impossible to achieve the international union of the proletariat or the peaceful and intelligent cooperation of these nations toward common aims just imagine joint international action by the italian hungarian german polish and russian workers under the political conditions preceding  the battles fought in  were thus not fought in vain nor have the fortyfive years separating us from that revolutionary epoch passed to no purpose the fruits are ripening and all i wish is that the publication of this italian translation may augur as well for the victory of the italian proletariat as the publication of the original did for the international revolution the manifesto does full justice to the revolutionary part played by capitalism in the past the first capitalist nation was italy the close of the feudal middle ages and the opening of the modern capitalist era are marked by a colossal figured an italian dante both the last poet of the middle ages and the first poet of modern times today as in  a new historical era is approaching will italy give us the new dante who will mark the hour of birth of this new proletarian era frederick engels london february   manifesto of the communist party a spectre is haunting europe  the spectre of communism all the powers of old europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre pope and tsar metternich and guizot french radicals and german policespies where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism against the more advanced opposition parties as well as against its reactionary adversaries two things result from this fact i communism is already acknowledged by all european powers to be itself a power ii it is high time that communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself to this end communists of various nationalities have assembled in london and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the english french german italian flemish and danish languages i bourgeois and proletarians the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guildmaster and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now open fight a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes in the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank in ancient rome we have patricians knights plebeians slaves in the middle ages feudal lords vassals guildmasters journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these classes again subordinate gradations the modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms it has but established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of struggle in place of the old ones   by bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour by proletariat the class of modern wage labourers who having no means of production of their own are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live engels  english edition  that is all written history in  the prehistory of society the social organisation existing previous to recorded history

history and by and by village communities were found to be or to have been the primitive form of society everywhere from india to ireland the inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare in its typical form by lewis henry morgans  crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe with the dissolution of the primeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes i have attempted to retrace this dissolution in the origin of the family private property and the state second edition

manifesto of the communist party our epoch the epoch of the bourgeoisie possesses however this distinct feature it has simplified class antagonisms society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes directly facing each other  bourgeoisie and proletariat from the serfs of the middle ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns from these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie the eastindian and chinese markets the colonisation of america trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development the feudal system of industry in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets the manufacturing system took its place the guildmasters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising even manufacturer no longer sufficed thereupon steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production the place of manufacture was taken by the giant modern industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires the leaders of the whole industrial armies the modern bourgeois modern industry has established the world market for which the discovery of america paved the way this market has given an immense development to commerce to navigation to communication by land this development has in its turn reacted on the extension of industry and in proportion as industry commerce navigation railways extended in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle ages we see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class an oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and selfgoverning association in the medieval commune  here independent urban republic as in italy and germany there taxable third estate of the monarchy as in france afterwards in the period of manufacturing proper serving either the semifeudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility and in fact cornerstone of the great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the establishment of modern industry and of the world market conquered for itself in the modern representative state exclusive political sway the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie historically has played a most revolutionary part the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked selfinterest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious   this was the name given their urban communities by the townsmen of italy and france after they had purchased or conquered their initial rights of selfgovernment from their feudal lords engels  german edition commune was the name taken in france by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local selfgovernment and political rights as the third estate generally speaking for the economical development of the bourgeoisie england is here taken as the typical country for its political development france engels  english edition  manifesto of the communist party fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom  free trade in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe it has converted the physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into its paid wage labourers the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the middle ages which reactionaries so much admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence it has been the first to show what mans activity can bring about it has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts and gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole relations of society conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones all fixed fastfrozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away all newformed ones become antiquated before they can ossify all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connexions everywhere the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all oldestablished national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the production of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and national seclusion and selfsufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national onesidedness and narrowmindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst ie to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image  manifesto of the communist party the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and semibarbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population of the means of production and of property it has agglomerated population centralised the means of production and has concentrated property in a few hands the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped together into one nation with one government one code of laws one national classinterest one frontier and one customstariff the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together subjection of natures forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steamnavigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground  what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal society at a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder they were burst asunder into their place stepped free competition accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial each time more threateningly in these crises a great part not only of the existing products but also of the previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity  the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented  manifesto of the communist party the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons  the modern working class  the proletarians in proportion as the bourgeoisie ie capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed  a class of labourers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital these labourers who must sell themselves piecemeal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market owing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labour the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance and for the propagation of his race but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labour is equal to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery etc modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of labourers crowded into the factory are organised like soldiers as privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine by the overlooker and above all by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is the less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class all are instruments of labour more or less expensive to use according to their age and sex no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer so far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper the pawnbroker etc the lower strata of the middle class  the small tradespeople shopkeepers and retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and peasants  all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is carried on by individual labourers then by the workpeople of a factory then by the operative of one trade in one locality against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour they smash to pieces machinery they set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the middle ages  manifesto of the communist party at this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country and broken up by their mutual competition if anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies this is not yet the consequence of their own active union but of the union of the bourgeoisie which class in order to attain its own political ends is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion and is moreover yet for a time able to do so at this stage therefore the proletarians do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies the remnants of absolute monarchy the landowners the nonindustrial bourgeois the petty bourgeois thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie but with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number it becomes concentrated in greater masses its strength grows and it feels that strength more the various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level the growing competition among the bourgeois and the resulting commercial crises make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating the increasing improvement of machinery ever more rapidly developing makes their livelihood more and more precarious the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes thereupon the workers begin to form combinations trades unions against the bourgeois they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts here and there the contest breaks out into riots now and then the workers are victorious but only for a time the real fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the ever expanding union of the workers this union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another it was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles all of the same character into one national struggle between classes but every class struggle is a political struggle and that union to attain which the burghers of the middle ages with their miserable highways required centuries the modern proletarian thanks to railways achieve in a few years this organisation of the proletarians into a class and consequently into a political party is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves but it ever rises up again stronger firmer mightier it compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself thus the tenhours bill in england was carried altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further in many ways the course of development of the proletariat the bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle at first with the aristocracy later on with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries in all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat to ask for help and thus to drag it into the political arena the bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education in other words it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling class are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence these also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress finally in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class in fact within the whole range of old society assumes such a violent glaring character that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins the revolutionary class the class that holds the future in its hands just as therefore at an earlier  manifesto of the communist party period a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat and in particular a portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class the other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry the proletariat is its special and essential product the lower middle class the small manufacturer the shopkeeper the artisan the peasant all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class they are therefore not revolutionary but conservative nay more they are reactionary for they try to roll back the wheel of history if by chance they are revolutionary they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat they thus defend not their present but their future interests they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat the dangerous class lumpenproletariat the social scum that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society may here and there be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution its conditions of life however prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue in the condition of the proletariat those of old society at large are already virtually swamped the proletarian is without property his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations modern industry labour modern subjection to capital the same in england as in france in america as in germany has stripped him of every trace of national character law morality religion are to him so many bourgeois prejudices behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests all the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation the proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation they have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify their mission is to destroy all previous securities for and insurances of individual property all previous historical movements were movements of minorities or in the interest of minorities the proletarian movement is the selfconscious independent movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority the proletariat the lowest stratum of our present society cannot stir cannot raise itself up without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air though not in substance yet in form the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle the proletariat of each country must of course first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie in depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat we traced the more or less veiled civil war raging within existing society up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat hitherto every form of society has been based as we have already seen on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes but in order to oppress a class certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can at least continue its slavish existence the serf in the period of serfdom raised himself to membership in the commune just as the petty bourgeois under the yoke of the feudal absolutism managed to develop into a bourgeois the modern labourer on the contrary instead of rising with the process of industry sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class he becomes a pauper and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth and here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as  manifesto of the communist party an overriding law it is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie in other words its existence is no longer compatible with society the essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital the condition for capital is wagelabour wagelabour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers the advance of industry whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie replaces the isolation of the labourers due to competition by the revolutionary combination due to association the development of modern industry therefore cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all are its own gravediggers its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable ii proletarians and communists in what relation do the communists stand to the proletarians as a whole the communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other workingclass parties they have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole they do not set up any sectarian principles of their own by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement the communists are distinguished from the other workingclass parties by this only  in the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat independently of all nationality  in the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole the communists therefore are on the one hand practically the most advanced and resolute section of the workingclass parties of every country that section which pushes forward all others on the other hand theoretically they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march the conditions and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement the immediate aim of the communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties formation of the proletariat into a class overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy conquest of political power by the proletariat the theoretical conclusions of the communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented or discovered by this or that wouldbe universal reformer they merely express in general terms actual relations springing from an existing class struggle from a historical movement going on under our very eyes the abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism all property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions the french revolution for example abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a mans own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence hardwon selfacquired selfearned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property but does wagelabour create any property for the labourer not a bit it creates capital ie that kind of property which exploits wagelabour and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wagelabour for fresh exploitation property in its present form is  chapter ii proletarians and communists based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour let us examine both sides of this antagonism to be a capitalist is to have not only a purely personal but a social status in production capital is a collective product and only by the united action of many members nay in the last resort only by the united action of all members of society can it be set in motion capital is therefore not only personal it is a social power when therefore capital is converted into common property into the property of all members of society personal property is not thereby transformed into social property it is only the social character of the property that is changed it loses its class character let us now take wagelabour the average price of wagelabour is the minimum wage ie that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer what therefore the wagelabourer appropriates by means of his labour merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence we by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others all that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it in bourgeois society living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour in communist society accumulated labour is but a means to widen to enrich to promote the existence of the labourer in bourgeois society therefore the past dominates the present in communist society the present dominates the past in bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality while the living person is dependent and has no individuality and the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois abolition of individuality and freedom and rightly so the abolition of bourgeois individuality bourgeois independence and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at by freedom is meant under the present bourgeois conditions of production free trade free selling and buying but if selling and buying disappears free selling and buying disappears also this talk about free selling and buying and all the other brave words of our bourgeois about freedom in general have a meaning if any only in contrast with restricted selling and buying with the fettered traders of the middle ages but have no meaning when opposed to the communistic abolition of buying and selling of the bourgeois conditions of production and of the bourgeoisie itself you are horrified at our intending to do away with private property but in your existing society private property is already done away with for ninetenths of the population its existence for the few is solely due to its nonexistence in the hands of those ninetenths you reproach us therefore with intending to do away with a form of property the necessary condition for whose existence is the nonexistence of any property for the immense majority of society in one word you reproach us with intending to do away with your property precisely so that is just what we intend from the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital money or rent into a social power capable of being monopolised ie from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property into capital from that moment you say individuality vanishes  chapter ii proletarians and communists you must therefore confess that by individual you mean no other person than the bourgeois than the middleclass owner of property this person must indeed be swept out of the way and made impossible communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations it has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease and universal laziness will overtake us according to this bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness for those of its members who work acquire nothing and those who acquire anything do not work the whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology that there can no longer be any wagelabour when there is no longer any capital all objections urged against the communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products have in the same way been urged against the communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products just as to the bourgeois the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture that culture the loss of which he laments is for the enormous majority a mere training to act as a machine but dont wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom culture law c your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class the selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property  historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production  this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you what you see clearly in the case of ancient property what you admit in the case of feudal property you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property abolition aufhebung of the family even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the communists on what foundation is the present family the bourgeois family based on capital on private gain in its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie but this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians and in public prostitution the bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents to this crime we plead guilty but you say we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we replace home education by social and your education is not that also social and determined by the social conditions under which you educate by the intervention direct or indirect of society by means of schools c the communists have not invented the intervention of society in education they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class the bourgeois claptrap about the family and education about the hallowed corelation of parents and child becomes all the more disgusting the more by the action of modern industry all the  chapter ii proletarians and communists family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour but you communists would introduce community of women screams the bourgeoisie in chorus the bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production he hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common and naturally can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women he has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production for the rest nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which they pretend is to be openly and officially established by the communists the communists have no need to introduce community of women it has existed almost from time immemorial our bourgeois not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal not to speak of common prostitutes take the greatest pleasure in seducing each others wives bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus at the most what the communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce in substitution for a hypocritically concealed an openly legalised community of women for the rest it is selfevident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system ie of prostitution both public and private the communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality the working men have no country we cannot take from them what they have not got since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy must rise to be the leading class of the nation must constitute itself the nation it is so far itself national though not in the bourgeois sense of the word national differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing owing to the development of the bourgeoisie to freedom of commerce to the world market to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster united action of the leading civilised countries at least is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat in proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to in proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end the charges against communism made from a religious a philosophical and generally from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination does it require deep intuition to comprehend that mans ideas views and conception in one word mans consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence in his social relations and in his social life what else does the history of ideas prove than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class when people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence when the ancient world was in its last throes the ancient religions were overcome by christianity when christian ideas succumbed in the th century to rationalist ideas feudal  chapter ii proletarians and communists society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie the ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge undoubtedly it will be said religious moral philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development but religion morality philosophy political science and law constantly survived this change there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc that are common to all states of society but communism abolishes eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of constituting them on a new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience what does this accusation reduce itself to the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs but whatever form they may have taken one fact is common to all past ages viz the exploitation of one part of society by the other no wonder then that the social consciousness of past ages despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays moves within certain common forms or general ideas which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms the communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas but let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communism we have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest by degree all capital from the bourgeoisie to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state ie of the proletariat organised as the ruling class and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible of course in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production by means of measures therefore which appear economically insufficient and untenable but which in the course of the movement outstrip themselves necessitate further inroads upon the old social order and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production these measures will of course be different in different countries nevertheless in most advanced countries the following will be pretty generally applicable  abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes  a heavy progressive or graduated income tax  abolition of all rights of inheritance  confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels  centralisation of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly  centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state  extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state the bringing into cultivation of wastelands and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan  equal liability of all to work establishment of industrial armies especially for agriculture  combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the  chapter ii proletarians and communists populace over the country  free education for all children in public schools abolition of childrens factory labour in its present form combination of education with industrial production c c when in the course of development class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its political character political power properly so called is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another if the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled by the force of circumstances to organise itself as a class if by means of a revolution it makes itself the ruling class and as such sweeps away by force the old conditions of production then it will along with these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all iii socialist and communist literature  reactionary socialism a feudal socialism owing to their historical position it became the vocation of the aristocracies of france and england to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society in the french revolution of july  and in the english reform agitation  these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart thenceforth a serious political struggle was altogether out of the question a literary battle alone remained possible but even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible in order to arouse sympathy the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight apparently of its own interests and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone thus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe in this way arose feudal socialism half lamentation half lampoon half an echo of the past half menace of the future at times by its bitter witty and incisive criticism striking the bourgeoisie to the very hearts core but always ludicrous in its effect through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history the aristocracy in order to rally the people to them waved the proletarian almsbag in front for a banner but the people so often as it joined them saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter one section of the french legitimists and young england exhibited this spectacle in pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated in showing that under their rule the modern proletariat never existed they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society for the rest so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this that under the bourgeois rgime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society what they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat in political practice therefore they join in all coercive measures against the working class and in ordinary life despite their highfalutin phrases they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry and to barter truth love and honour for traffic in wool beetrootsugar and potato spirits as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord so has clerical socialism with feudal socialism   not the english restoration  but the french restoration  note by engels to the english edition of   this applies chiefly to germany where the landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for their own account by stewards and are moreover extensive beetrootsugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits the wealthier british aristocracy are as yet rather above that but they too know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to floaters or more or less shady jointstock companies note by engels to the english edition of   chapter iii socialist and communist literature nothing is easier than to give christian asceticism a socialist tinge has not christianity declaimed against private property against marriage against the state has it not preached in the place of these charity and poverty celibacy and mortification of the flesh monastic life and mother church christian socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heartburnings of the aristocrat b pettybourgeois socialism the feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society the medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie in those countries which are but little developed industrially and commercially these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society the individual members of this class however are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition and as modern industry develops they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society to be replaced in manufactures agriculture and commerce by overlookers bailiffs and shopmen in countries like france where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use in their criticism of the bourgeois rgime the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class thus arose pettybourgeois socialism sismondi was the head of this school not only in france but also in england this school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production it laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists it proved incontrovertibly the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour the concentration of capital and land in a few hands overproduction and crises it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant the misery of the proletariat the anarchy in production the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth the industrial war of extermination between nations the dissolution of old moral bonds of the old family relations of the old nationalities in its positive aims however this form of socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange and with them the old property relations and the old society or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old property relations that have been and were bound to be exploded by those means in either case it is both reactionary and utopian its last words are corporate guilds for manufacture patriarchal relations in agriculture ultimately when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of selfdeception this form of socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues c german or true socialism the socialist and communist literature of france a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power was introduced into germany at a time when the bourgeoisie in that country had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism german philosophers wouldbe philosophers and beaux esprits men of letters eagerly seized on this literature only forgetting that when these writings immigrated from france into germany french social conditions had not immigrated along with them in contact with german  chapter iii socialist and communist literature social conditions this french literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary aspect thus to the german philosophers of the eighteenth century the demands of the first french revolution were nothing more than the demands of practical reason in general and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary french bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the laws of pure will of will as it was bound to be of true human will generally the work of the german literati consisted solely in bringing the new french ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience or rather in annexing the french ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view this annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated namely by translation it is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of catholic saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written the german literati reversed this process with the profane french literature they wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the french original for instance beneath the french criticism of the economic functions of money they wrote alienation of humanity and beneath the french criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote dethronement of the category of the general and so forth the introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the french historical criticisms they dubbed philosophy of action true socialism german science of socialism philosophical foundation of socialism and so on the french socialist and communist literature was thus completely emasculated and since it ceased in the hands of the german to express the struggle of one class with the other he felt conscious of having overcome french onesidedness and of representing not true requirements but the requirements of truth not the interests of the proletariat but the interests of human nature of man in general who belongs to no class has no reality who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy this german socialism which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly and extolled its poor stockintrade in such a mountebank fashion meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence the fight of the germans and especially of the prussian bourgeoisie against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy in other words the liberal movement became more earnest by this the longwished for opportunity was offered to true socialism of confronting the political movement with the socialist demands of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism against representative government against bourgeois competition bourgeois freedom of the press bourgeois legislation bourgeois liberty and equality and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain and everything to lose by this bourgeois movement german socialism forgot in the nick of time that the french criticism whose silly echo it was presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society with its corresponding economic conditions of existence and the political constitution adapted thereto the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in germany to the absolute governments with their following of parsons professors country squires and officials it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie it was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets with which these same governments just at that time dosed the german workingclass risings while this true socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the german bourgeoisie it at the same time directly represented a reactionary interest the interest of german philistines in germany the pettybourgeois class a relic of the sixteenth century and since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms is the real social basis of the existing state of things  chapter iii socialist and communist literature to preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in germany the industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction  on the one hand from the concentration of capital on the other from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat true socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone it spread like an epidemic the robe of speculative cobwebs embroidered with flowers of rhetoric steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment this transcendental robe in which the german socialists wrapped their sorry eternal truths all skin and bone served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public and on its part german socialism recognised more and more its own calling as the bombastic representative of the pettybourgeois philistine it proclaimed the german nation to be the model nation and the german petty philistine to be the typical man to every villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden higher socialistic interpretation the exact contrary of its real character it went to the extreme length of directly opposing the brutally destructive tendency of communism and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles with very few exceptions all the socalled socialist and communist publications that now  circulate in germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature  conservative or bourgeois socialism a part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society to this section belong economists philanthropists humanitarians improvers of the condition of the working class organisers of charity members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals temperance fanatics holeandcorner reformers of every imaginable kind this form of socialism has moreover been worked out into complete systems we may cite proudhons philosophie de la misre as an example of this form the socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom they desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements they wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat the bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best and bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems in requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system and thereby to march straightway into the social new jerusalem it but requires in reality that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie a second and more practical but less systematic form of this socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform but only a change in the material conditions of existence in economical relations could be of any advantage to them by changes in the material conditions of existence this form of socialism however by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution but administrative reforms based on the continued existence of these relations reforms therefore that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour but at the best lessen the cost and simplify the administrative work of bourgeois government   the revolutionary storm of  swept away this whole shabby tendency and cured its protagonists of the desire to dabble in socialism the chief representative and classical type of this tendency is mr karl gruen note by engels to the german edition of   chapter iii socialist and communist literature bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when and only when it becomes a mere figure of speech free trade for the benefit of the working class protective duties for the benefit of the working class prison reform for the benefit of the working class this is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism it is summed up in the phrase the bourgeois is a bourgeois  for the benefit of the working class  criticalutopian socialism and communism we do not here refer to that literature which in every great modern revolution has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat such as the writings of babeuf and others the first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends made in times of universal excitement when feudal society was being overthrown necessarily failed owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation conditions that had yet to be produced and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone the revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character it inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form the socialist and communist systems properly so called those of saintsimon fourier owen and others spring into existence in the early undeveloped period described above of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie see section i bourgeois and proletarians the founders of these systems see indeed the class antagonisms as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society but the proletariat as yet in its infancy offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry the economic situation as they find it does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat they therefore search after a new social science after new social laws that are to create these conditions historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones and the gradual spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors future history resolves itself in their eyes into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans in the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class as being the most suffering class only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them the undeveloped state of the class struggle as well as their own surroundings causes socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms they want to improve the condition of every member of society even that of the most favoured hence they habitually appeal to society at large without the distinction of class nay by preference to the ruling class for how can people when once they understand their system fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society hence they reject all political and especially all revolutionary action they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means necessarily doomed to failure and by the force of example to pave the way for the new social gospel such fantastic pictures of future society painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society  chapter iii socialist and communist literature but these socialist and communist publications contain also a critical element they attack every principle of existing society hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class the practical measures proposed in them  such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country of the family of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals and of the wage system the proclamation of social harmony the conversion of the function of the state into a mere superintendence of production  all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were at that time only just cropping up and which in these publications are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only these proposals therefore are of a purely utopian character the significance of criticalutopian socialism and communism bears an inverse relation to historical development in proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape this fantastic standing apart from the contest these fantastic attacks on it lose all practical value and all theoretical justification therefore although the originators of these systems were in many respects revolutionary their disciples have in every case formed mere reactionary sects they hold fast by the original views of their masters in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat they therefore endeavour and that consistently to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms they still dream of experimental realisation of their social utopias of founding isolated phalansteres of establishing home colonies or setting up a little icaria  duodecimo editions of the new jerusalem  and to realise all these castles in the air they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois by degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary or conservative socialists depicted above differing from these only by more systematic pedantry and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science they therefore violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class such action according to them can only result from blind unbelief in the new gospel the owenites in england and the fourierists in france respectively oppose the chartists and the rformistes   phalanstres were socialist colonies on the plan of charles fourier icaria was the name given by cabet to his utopia and later on to his american communist colony note by engels to the english edition of  home colonies were what owen called his communist model societies phalanstres was the name of the public palaces planned by fourier icaria was the name given to the utopian land of fancy whose communist institutions cabet portrayed note by engels to the german edition of  iv position of the communists in relation to the various existing opposition parties section ii has made clear the relations of the communists to the existing workingclass parties such as the chartists in england and the agrarian reformers in america the communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class but in the movement of the present they also represent and take care of the future of that movement in france the communists ally with the socialdemocrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie reserving however the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great revolution in switzerland they support the radicals without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements partly of democratic socialists in the french sense partly of radical bourgeois in poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation that party which fomented the insurrection of cracow in  in germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy the feudal squirearchy and the petty bourgeoisie but they never cease for a single instant to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat in order that the german workers may straightway use as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy and in order that after the fall of the reactionary classes in germany the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin the communists turn their attention chiefly to germany because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of european civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of england was in the seventeenth and france in the eighteenth century and because the bourgeois revolution in germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution in short the communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things in all these movements they bring to the front as the leading question in each the property question no matter what its degree of development at the time finally they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win working men of all countries unite   the party then represented in parliament by ledrurollin in literature by louis blanc in the daily press by the rforme the name of socialdemocracy signifies with these its inventors a section of the democratic or republican party more or less tinged with socialism engels english edition  letter from engels to marx  november  paris  november  dear marx not until this evening was it decided that i should be coming saturday evening then in ostend htel de la couronne just opposite the railway station beside the harbour and sunday morning across the water if you take the train that leaves between  and  youll arrive at about the same time as i do  tuesday evening verte pto give a little thought to the confession of faith i think we would do best to abandon the catechetical form and call the thing communist manifesto since a certain amount of history has to be narrated in it the form hitherto adopted is quite unsuitable i shall be bringing with me the one from here which i did principles of communism it is in simple narrative form but wretchedly worded in a tearing hurry i start off by asking what is communism and then straight on to the proletariat  the history of its origins how it differs from earlier workers development of the antithesis between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie crises conclusions in between all kinds of secondary matter and finally the communists party policy in so far as it should be made public the one here has not yet been submitted in its entirety for endorsement but save for a few quite minor points i think i can get it through in such a form that at least there is nothing in it which conflicts with our views    from mecw volume  p  written  november  first published in der briefwechsel zwischen f engels und k marx  draft of a communist confession of faith this document is the draft programme discussed at the first congress of the communist league in london on june   the congress was a final stage in the reorganisation of the league of the just  an organisation of german workers and craftsmen which was founded in paris in  and soon acquired an international character having communities in germany france switzerland britain and sweden the activity of marx and engels directed towards the ideological and organisational unity of the socialists and advanced workers prompted the leaders of the league karl schapper joseph moll heinrich bauer who resided in london front november  to ask for their help in reorganising the league and drafting its new program me when marx and engels were convinced that the leaders of the league of the just were ready to accept the principles of scientific communism as its programme they accepted the offer to join the league made to them late in january  engels active participation in the work of the congress marx was unable to go to london affected the course and the results of its proceedings the league was renamed the communist league the old motto of the league of the just all men are brothers was replaced by a new marxist one working men of all countries unite  the draft programme and the draft rules of the league were approved at the last sitting on june   the full text of the draft of a communist confession of faith credo became known only in  it was found by the swiss scholar bert andras together with the draft rules and the circular of the first congress to the members of the league in the archives of joachim friedrich martens an active member of the communist league which are kept in the state and university library in hamburg this discovery made it possible to ascertain a number of important points in the history of the communist league and the drafting of its programme documents it had been previously assumed that the first congress did no more than adopt a decision to draw up a programme and that the draft itself was made by the london central authority of the communist league joseph moll karl schapper and heinrich bauer after the congress between june and august  the new documents show that the draft was ready by june   and that its author was engels the manuscript found in martens archives with the exception of some inserted words the concluding sentence and the signatures of the president and the secretary of the congress was written in engels hand the document testifies to engels great influence on the discussion of the programme at the congress  the formulation of the answers to most of the questions is a marxist one besides while drafting the programme engels had to take into account that the members of the league had not yet freed themselves from the influence of utopian ideas and this was reflected in the formulation of the first six questions and answers the form of a revolutionary catechism was also commonly used in the league of the just and other organisations of workers and craftsmen at the time it may he assumed that engels intended to give greater precision to some of the formulations of the programme document in the course of further discussion and revision after the first congress of the communist league the draft of a communist confession of faith was sent together with the draft rules to the communities for discussion the results of which were to be taken into account at the time of the final approval of the programme and the rules at the second congress when working on another improved draft programme the principles of communism in late october  engels made direct use of the confession of faith as can be seen from the coincidences of the texts and also from references in the principles to the earlier document when engels had apparently decided to leave formulations of some of the answers as they were   from mecw volume  p  written by engels june   first published in grndungsdokumente des bundes der kommunisten hamburg  in english in birth of the communist manifesto international publishers   draft of a communist confession of faith a communist confession of faith question  are you a communist answer yes question  what is the aim of the communists answer to organise society in such a way that every member of it can develop and use all his capabilities and powers in complete freedom and without thereby infringing the basic conditions of this society question  how do you wish to achieve this aim answer by the elimination of private property and its replacement by community of property question  on what do you base your community of property answer firstly on the mass of productive forces and means of subsistence resulting from the development of industry agriculture trade and colonisation and on the possibility inherent in machinery chemical and other resources of their infinite extension secondly on the fact that in the consciousness or feeling of every individual there exist certain irrefutable basic principles which being the result of the whole of historical development require no proof question  what are such principles answer for example every individual strives to be happy the happiness of the individual is inseparable from the happiness of all etc question  how do you wish to prepare the way for your community of property answer by enlightening and uniting the proletariat question  what is the proletariat answer the proletariat is that class of society which lives exclusively by its labour and not on the profit from any kind of capital that class whose weal and woe whose life and death therefore depend on the alternation of times of good and bad business in a word on the fluctuations of competition question  then there have not always been proletarians answer no there have always been poor and working classes and those who worked were almost always the poor but there have not always been proletarians just as competition has not always been free question  how did the proletariat arise answer the proletariat came into being as a result of the introduction of the machines which have been invented since the middle of the last century and the most important of which are the steamengine the spinning machine and the power loom these machines which were very expensive and could therefore only be purchased by rich people supplanted the workers of the time because by the use of machinery it was possible to produce commodities more quickly and cheaply than could the workers with their imperfect spinning wheels and handlooms the machines thus delivered industry entirely into the hands of the big capitalists and rendered the workers scanty property which consisted mainly of their tools looms etc quite worthless so that the capitalist was left with everything the worker with nothing in this way the factory system was  draft of a communist confession of faith introduced once the capitalists saw how advantageous this was for them they sought to extend it to more and more branches of labour they divided work more and more between the workers so that workers who formerly had made a whole article now produced only a part of it labour simplified in this way produced goods more quickly and therefore more cheaply and only now was it found in almost every branch of labour that here also machines could be used as soon as any branch of labour went over to factory production it ended up just as in the case of spinning and weaving in the hands of the big capitalists and the workers were deprived of the last remnants of their independence we have gradually arrived at the position where almost all branches of labour are run on a factory basis this has increasingly brought about the ruin of the previously existing middle class especially of the small master craftsmen completely transformed the previous position of the workers and two new classes which are gradually swallowing up all other classes have come into being namely i the class of the big capitalists who in all advanced countries are in almost exclusive possession of the means of subsistence and those means machines factories workshops etc by which these means of subsistence are produced this is the bourgeois class or the bourgeoisie ii the class of the completely propertyless who are compelled to sell their labour to the first class the bourgeois simply to obtain from them in return their means of subsistence since the parties to this trading in labour are not equal but the bourgeois have the advantage the propertyless must submit to the bad conditions laid down by the bourgeois this class dependent on the bourgeois is called the class of the proletarians or the proletariat question  in what way does the proletarian differ from the slave answer the slave is sold once and for all the proletarian has to sell himself by the day and by the hour the slave is the property of one master and for that very reason has a guaranteed subsistence however wretched it may be the proletarian is so to speak the slave of the entire bourgeois class not of one master and therefore has no guaranteed subsistence since nobody buys his labour if he does not need it the slave is accounted a thing and not a member of civil society the proletarian is recognised as a person as a member of civil society the slave may therefore have a better subsistence than the proletarian but the latter stands at a higher stage of development the slave frees himself by becoming a proletarian abolishing from the totality of property relationships only the relationship of slavery the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing property in general question  in what way does the proletarian differ from the serf answer the serf has the use of a piece of land that is of an instrument of production in return for handing over a greater or lesser portion of the yield the proletarian works with instruments of production which belong to someone else who in return for his labour hands over to him a portion determined by competition of the products in the case of the serf the share of the labourer is determined by his own labour that is by himself in the case of the proletarian it is determined by competition therefore in the first place by the bourgeois the serf has guaranteed subsistence the proletarian has not the serf frees himself by driving out his feudal lord and becoming a property owner himself thus entering into competition and joining for the time being the possessing class the privileged class the proletarian frees himself by doing away with property competition and all class differences  draft of a communist confession of faith question  in what way does the proletarian differ from the handicraftsman answer as opposed to the proletarian the socalled handicraftsman who still existed nearly everywhere during the last century and still exists here and there is at most a temporary proletarian his aim is to acquire capital himself and so to exploit other workers he can often achieve this aim where the craft guilds still exist or where freedom to follow a trade has not yet led to the organisation of handwork on a factory basis and to intense competition but as soon as the factory system is introduced into handwork and competition is in full swing this prospect is eliminated and the handicraftsman becomes more and more a proletarian the handicraftsman therefore frees himself either by becoming a bourgeois or in general passing over into the middle class or by becoming a proletarian as a result of competition as now happens in most cases and joining the movement of the proletariat  i e the more or less conscious communist movement question  then you do not believe that community of property has been possible at any time answer no communism has only arisen since machinery and other inventions made it possible to hold out the prospect of an allsided development a happy existence for all members of society communism is the theory of a liberation which was not possible for the slaves the serfs or the handicraftsmen but only for the proletarians and hence it belongs of necessity to the th century and was not possible in any earlier period question  let m go back to the sixth question as you wish to prepare for community of property by the enlightening and uniting of the proletariat then you reject revolution answer we are convinced not only of the uselessness but even of the harmfulness of all conspiracies we are also aware that revolutions are not made deliberately and arbitrarily but that everywhere and at all times they are the necessary consequence of circumstances which are not in any way whatever dependent either on the will or on the leadership of individual parties or of whole classes but we also see that the development of the proletariat in almost all countries of the world is forcibly repressed by the possessing classes and that thus a revolution is being forcibly worked for by the opponents of communism if in the end the oppressed proletariat is thus driven into a revolution then we will defend the cause of the proletariat just as well by our deeds as now by our words question  do you intend to replace the existing social order by community of property at one stroke answer we have no such intention the development of the masses cannot he ordered by decree it is determined by the development of the conditions in which these masses live and therefore proceeds gradually question  how do you think the transition from the present situation to community of property is to be effected answer the first fundamental condition for the introduction of community of property is the political liberation of the proletariat through a democratic constitution question  what will be your first measure once you have established democracy answer guaranteeing the subsistence of the proletariat question  how will you do this  draft of a communist confession of faith answer i by limiting private property in such a way that it gradually prepares the way for its transformation into social property e g by progressive taxation limitation of the right of inheritance in favour of the state etc etc ii by employing workers in national workshops and factories and on national estates iii by educating all children at the expense of the state question  how will you arrange this kind of education during the period of transition answer all children will be educated in state establishments from the time when they can do without the first maternal care question  will not the introduction of community of property be accompanied by the proclamation of the community of women answer by no means we will only interfere in the personal relationship between men and women or with the family in general to the extent that the maintenance of the existing institution would disturb the new social order besides we are well aware that the family relationship has been modified in the course of history by the property relationships and by periods of development and that consequently the ending of private property will also have a most important influence on it question  will nationalities continue to exist under communism answer the nationalities of the peoples who join together according to the principle of community will be just as much compelled by this union to merge with one another and thereby supersede themselves as the various differences between estates and classes disappear through the superseding of their basis  private property question  do communists reject existing religions answer all religions which have existed hitherto were expressions of historical stages of development of individual peoples or groups of peoples but communism is that stage of historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous and supersedes them in the name and on the mandate of the congress secretary heide alias of wilhelm wolff in the league of the just president karl schill alias of karl schapper in the league of the just london june   the principles of communism in  engels wrote two draft programmes for the communist league in the form of a catechism one in june and the other in october the latter which is known as principles of communism was first published in  the earlier document draft of the communist confession of faith was only found in  it was first published in  in hamburg together with four other documents pertaining to the first congress of the communist league in a booklet entitled grndungs dokumente des bundes der kommunisten juni bis september  founding documents of the communist league at the june  congress of the league of the just which was also the founding conference of the communist league it was decided to issue a draft confession of faith to be submitted for discussion to the sections of the league the document which has now come to light is almost certainly this draft comparison of the two documents shows that principles of communism is a revised edition of this earlier draft in principles of communism engels left three questions unanswered in two cases with the notation unchanged bleibt this clearly refers to the answers provided in the earlier draft the new draft for the programme was worked out by engels on the instructions of the leading body of the paris circle of the communist league the instructions were decided on after engels sharp criticism at the committee meeting on october   of the draft programme drawn up by the true socialist moses hess which was then rejected still considering principles of communism as a preliminary draft engels expressed the view in a letter to marx dated november   that it would be best to drop the old catechistic form and draw up a programme in the form of a manifesto at the second congress of the communist league november december   marx and engels defended the fundamental scientific principles of communism and were trusted with drafting a programme in the form of a manifesto of the communist party in writing the manifesto the founders of marxism made use of the propositions enunciated in principles of communism engels uses the term manufaktur and its derivatives which have been translated manufacture manufacturing etc engels used this word literally to indicate production by hand not factory production for which engels uses big industry manufaktur differs from handicraft guild production in mediaeval towns in that the latter was carried out by independent artisans manufacktur is carried out by homeworkers working for merchant capitalists or by groups of craftspeople working together in large workshops owned by capitalists it is therefore a transitional mode of production between guild handicraft and modern capitalist forms of production   written octobernovember  source selected works volume one p  progress publishers moscow  first published  by eduard bernstein in the german

selected works peking foreign languages press  with editorial additions by marxistsorg  draft of a communist confession of faith the principles of communism    what is communism communism is the doctrine of the conditions of the liberation of the proletariat    what is the proletariat the proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital whose weal and woe whose life and death whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor  hence on the changing state of business on the vagaries of unbridled competition the proletariat or the class of proletarians is in a word the working class of the th century    proletarians then have not always existed no there have always been poor and working classes and the working class have mostly been poor but there have not always been workers and poor people living under conditions as they are today in other words there have not always been proletarians any more than there has always been free unbridled competitions    how did the proletariat originate the proletariat originated in the industrial revolution which took place in england in the last half of the last th century and which has since then been repeated in all the civilized countries of the world this industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam engine various spinning machines the mechanical loom and a whole series of other mechanical devices these machines which were very expensive and hence could be bought only by big capitalists altered the whole mode of production and displaced the former workers because the machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers could produce with their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms the machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the big capitalists and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers tools looms etc the result was that the capitalists soon had everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers this marked the introduction of the factory system into the textile industry once the impulse to the introduction of machinery and the factory system had been given this system spread quickly to all other branches of industry especially cloth and bookprinting pottery and the metal industries labor was more and more divided among the individual workers so that the worker who previously had done a complete piece of work now did only a part of that piece this division of labor made it possible to produce things faster and cheaper it reduced the activity of the individual worker to simple endlessly repeated mechanical motions which could be performed not only as well but much better by a machine in this way all these industries fell one after another under the dominance of steam machinery and the factory system just as spinning and weaving had already done but at the same time they also fell into the hands of big capitalists and their workers were deprived of whatever independence remained to them gradually not only genuine manufacture but also handicrafts came within the province of the factory system as big capitalists increasingly  draft of a communist confession of faith displaced the small master craftsmen by setting up huge workshops which saved many expenses and permitted an elaborate division of labor this is how it has come about that in civilized countries at the present time nearly all kinds of labor are performed in factories  and in nearly all branches of work handicrafts and manufacture have been superseded this process has to an ever greater degree ruined the old middle class especially the small handicraftsmen it has entirely transformed the condition of the workers and two new classes have been created which are gradually swallowing up all the others these are i the class of big capitalists who in all civilized countries are already in almost exclusive possession of all the means of subsistence and of the instruments machines factories and materials necessary for the production of the means of subsistence this is the bourgeois class or the bourgeoisie ii the class of the wholly propertyless who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order to get in exchange the means of subsistence for their support this is called the class of proletarians or the proletariat    under what conditions does this sale of the labor of the proletarians to the bourgeoisie take place labor is a commodity like any other and its price is therefore determined by exactly the same laws that apply to other commodities in a regime of big industry or of free competition  as we shall see the two come to the same thing  the price of a commodity is on the average always equal to its cost of production hence the price of labor is also equal to the cost of production of labor but the costs of production of labor consist of precisely the quantity of means of subsistence necessary to enable the worker to continue working and to prevent the working class from dying out the worker will therefore get no more for his labor than is necessary for this purpose the price of labor or the wage will in other words be the lowest the minimum required for the maintenance of life however since business is sometimes better and sometimes worse it follows that the worker sometimes gets more and sometimes gets less for his commodities but again just as the industrialist on the average of good times and bad gets no more and no less for his commodities than what they cost similarly on the average the worker gets no more and no less than his minimum this economic law of wages operates the more strictly the greater the degree to which big industry has taken possession of all branches of production    what working classes were there before the industrial revolution the working classes have always according to the different stages of development of society lived in different circumstances and had different relations to the owning and ruling classes in antiquity the workers were the slaves of the owners just as they still are in many backward countries and even in the southern part of the united states in the middle ages they were the serfs of the landowning nobility as they still are in hungary poland and russia in the middle ages and indeed right up to the industrial revolution there were also journeymen in the cities who worked in the service of petty bourgeois masters  draft of a communist confession of faith gradually as manufacture developed these journeymen became manufacturing workers who were even then employed by larger capitalists    in what way do proletarians differ from slaves the slave is sold once and for all the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly the individual slave property of one master is assured an existence however miserable it may be because of the masters interest the individual proletarian property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has need of it has no secure existence this existence is assured only to the class as a whole the slave is outside competition the proletarian is in it and experiences all its vagaries the slave counts as a thing not as a member of society thus the slave can have a better existence than the proletarian while the proletarian belongs to a higher stage of social development and himself stands on a higher social level than the slave the slave frees himself when of all the relations of private property he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general    in what way do proletarians differ from serfs the serf possesses and uses an instrument of production a piece of land in exchange for which he gives up a part of his product or part of the services of his labor the proletarian works with the instruments of production of another for the account of this other in exchange for a part of the product the serf gives up the proletarian receives the serf has an assured existence the proletarian has not the serf is outside competition the proletarian is in it the serf liberates himself in one of three ways either he runs away to the city and there becomes a handicraftsman or instead of products and services he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a free tenant or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner in short by one route or another he gets into the owning class and enters into competition the proletarian liberates himself by abolishing competition private property and all class differences    in what way do proletarians differ from handicraftsmen in contrast to the proletarian the socalled handicraftsman as he still existed almost everywhere in the past eighteenth century and still exists here and there at present is a proletarian at most temporarily his goal is to acquire capital himself wherewith to exploit other workers he can often achieve this goal where guilds still exist or where freedom from guild restrictions has not yet led to the introduction of factorystyle methods into the crafts nor yet to fierce competition but as soon as the factory system has been introduced into the crafts and competition flourishes fully this perspective dwindles away and the handicraftsman becomes more and more a proletarian the handicraftsman therefore frees himself by becoming either bourgeois or entering the middle class in general or becoming a proletarian because of competition as is now more often the case in which case he can free himself by joining the proletarian movement ie the more or less communist movement  draft of a communist confession of faith    in what way do proletarians differ from manufacturing workers the manufacturing worker of the th to the th centuries still had with but few exception an instrument of production in his own possession  his loom the family spinning wheel a little plot of land which he cultivated in his spare time the proletarian has none of these things the manufacturing worker almost always lives in the countryside and in a more or less patriarchal relation to his landlord or employer the proletarian lives for the most part in the city and his relation to his employer is purely a cash relation the manufacturing worker is torn out of his patriarchal relation by big industry loses whatever property he still has and in this way becomes a proletarian    what were the immediate consequences of the industrial revolution and of the division of society into bourgeoisie and proletariat first the lower and lower prices of industrial products brought about by machine labor totally destroyed in all countries of the world the old system of manufacture or industry based upon hand labor in this way all semibarbarian countries which had hitherto been more or less strangers to historical development and whose industry had been based on manufacture were violently forced out of their isolation they bought the cheaper commodities of the english and allowed their own manufacturing workers to be ruined countries which had known no progress for thousands of years  for example india  were thoroughly revolutionized and even china is now on the way to a revolution we have come to the point where a new machine invented in england deprives millions of chinese workers of their livelihood within a years time in this way big industry has brought all the people of the earth into contact with each other has merged all local markets into one world market has spread civilization and progress everywhere and has thus ensured that whatever happens in civilized countries will have repercussions in all other countries it follows that if the workers in england or france now liberate themselves this must set off revolution in all other countries  revolutions which sooner or later must accomplish the liberation of their respective working class second wherever big industries displaced manufacture the bourgeoisie developed in wealth and power to the utmost and made itself the first class of the country the result was that wherever this happened the bourgeoisie took political power into its own hands and displaced the hitherto ruling classes the aristocracy the guildmasters and their representative the absolute monarchy the bourgeoisie annihilated the power of the aristocracy the nobility by abolishing the entailment of estates  in other words by making landed property subject to purchase and sale and by doing away with the special privileges of the nobility it destroyed the power of the guildmasters by abolishing guilds and handicraft privileges in their place it put competition  that is a state of society in which everyone has the right to enter into any branch of industry the only obstacle being a lack of the necessary capital the introduction of free competition is thus public declaration that from now on the members of society are unequal only to the extent that their capitals are unequal that capital is the decisive power and that therefore the capitalists the bourgeoisie have become the first class in society  draft of a communist confession of faith free competition is necessary for the establishment of big industry because it is the only condition of society in which big industry can make its way having destroyed the social power of the nobility and the guildmasters the bourgeois also destroyed their political power having raised itself to the actual position of first class in society it proclaims itself to be also the dominant political class this it does through the introduction of the representative system which rests on bourgeois equality before the law and the recognition of free competition and in european countries takes the form of constitutional monarchy in these constitutional monarchies only those who possess a certain capital are voters  that is to say only members of the bourgeoisie these bourgeois voters choose the deputies and these bourgeois deputies by using their right to refuse to vote taxes choose a bourgeois government third everywhere the proletariat develops in step with the bourgeoisie in proportion as the bourgeoisie grows in wealth the proletariat grows in numbers for since the proletarians can be employed only by capital and since capital extends only through employing labor it follows that the growth of the proletariat proceeds at precisely the same pace as the growth of capital simultaneously this process draws members of the bourgeoisie and proletarians together into the great cities where industry can be carried on most profitably and by thus throwing great masses in one spot it gives to the proletarians a consciousness of their own strength moreover the further this process advances the more new laborsaving machines are invented the greater is the pressure exercised by big industry on wages which as we have seen sink to their minimum and therewith render the condition of the proletariat increasingly unbearable the growing dissatisfaction of the proletariat thus joins with its rising power to prepare a proletarian social revolution    what were the further consequences of the industrial revolution big industry created in the steam engine and other machines the means of endlessly expanding industrial production speeding it up and cutting its costs with production thus facilitated the free competition which is necessarily bound up with big industry assumed the most extreme forms a multitude of capitalists invaded industry and in a short while more was produced than was needed as a consequence finished commodities could not be sold and a socalled commercial crisis broke out factories had to be closed their owners went bankrupt and the workers were without bread deepest misery reigned everywhere after a time the superfluous products were sold the factories began to operate again wages rose and gradually business got better than ever but it was not long before too many commodities were again produced and a new crisis broke out only to follow the same course as its predecessor ever since the beginning of this th century the condition of industry has constantly fluctuated between periods of prosperity and periods of crisis nearly every five to seven years a fresh crisis has intervened always with the greatest hardship for workers and always accompanied by general revolutionary stirrings and the direct peril to the whole existing order of things    what follows from these periodic commercial crises first that though big industry in its earliest stage created free competition it has now outgrown free competition  draft of a communist confession of faith that for big industry competition and generally the individualistic organization of production have become a fetter which it must and will shatter that so long as big industry remains on its present footing it can be maintained only at the cost of general chaos every seven years each time threatening the whole of civilization and not only plunging the proletarians into misery but also ruining large sections of the bourgeoisie hence either that big industry must itself be given up which is an absolute impossibility or that it makes unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which production is no longer directed by mutually competing individual industrialists but rather by the whole society operating according to a definite plan and taking account of the needs of all second that big industry and the limitless expansion of production which it makes possible bring within the range of feasibility a social order in which so much is produced that every member of society will be in a position to exercise and develop all his powers and faculties in complete freedom it thus appears that the very qualities of big industry which in our presentday society produce misery and crises are those which in a different form of society will abolish this misery and these catastrophic depressions we see with the greatest clarity i that all these evils are from now on to be ascribed solely to a social order which no longer corresponds to the requirements of the real situation and ii that it is possible through a new social order to do away with these evils altogether    what will this new social order have to be like above all it will have to take the control of industry and of all branches of production out of the hands of mutually competing individuals and instead institute a system in which all these branches of production are operated by society as a whole  that is for the common account according to a common plan and with the participation of all members of society it will in other words abolish competition and replace it with association moreover since the management of industry by individuals necessarily implies private property and since competition is in reality merely the manner and form in which the control of industry by private property owners expresses itself it follows that private property cannot be separated from competition and the individual management of industry private property must therefore be abolished and in its place must come the common utilization of all instruments of production and the distribution of all products according to common agreement  in a word what is called the communal ownership of goods in fact the abolition of private property is doubtless the shortest and most significant way to characterize the revolution in the whole social order which has been made necessary by the development of industry  and for this reason it is rightly advanced by communists as their main demand  draft of a communist confession of faith    was not the abolition of private property possible at an earlier time no every change in the social order every revolution in property relations is the necessary consequence of the creation of new forces of production which no longer fit into the old property relations private property has not always existed when towards the end of the middle ages there arose a new mode of production which could not be carried on under the then existing feudal and guild forms of property this manufacture which had outgrown the old property relations created a new property form private property and for manufacture and the earliest stage of development of big industry private property was the only possible property form the social order based on it was the only possible social order so long as it is not possible to produce so much that there is enough for all with more left over for expanding the social capital and extending the forces of production  so long as this is not possible there must always be a ruling class directing the use of societys productive forces and a poor oppressed class how these classes are constituted depends on the stage of development the agrarian middle ages give us the baron and the serf the cities of the later middle ages show us the guildmaster and the journeyman and the day laborer the th century has its manufacturing workers the th has big factory owners and proletarians it is clear that up to now the forces of production have never been developed to the point where enough could be developed for all and that private property has become a fetter and a barrier in relation to the further development of the forces of production now however the development of big industry has ushered in a new period capital and the forces of production have been expanded to an unprecedented extent and the means are at hand to multiply them without limit in the near future moreover the forces of production have been concentrated in the hands of a few bourgeois while the great mass of the people are more and more falling into the proletariat their situation becoming more wretched and intolerable in proportion to the increase of wealth of the bourgeoisie and finally these mighty and easily extended forces of production have so far outgrown private property and the bourgeoisie that they threaten at any moment to unleash the most violent disturbances of the social order now under these conditions the abolition of private property has become not only possible but absolutely necessary    will the peaceful abolition of private property be possible it would be desirable if this could happen and the communists would certainly be the last to oppose it communists know only too well that all conspiracies are not only useless but even harmful they know all too well that revolutions are not made intentionally and arbitrarily but that everywhere and always they have been the necessary consequence of conditions which were wholly independent of the will and direction of individual parties and entire classes but they also see that the development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has been violently suppressed and that in this way the opponents of communism have been working toward a revolution with all their strength if the oppressed proletariat is finally driven to revolution then we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them with words  draft of a communist confession of faith    will it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke no no more than existing forces of production can at one stroke be multiplied to the extent necessary for the creation of a communal society in all probability the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity    what will be the course of this revolution above all it will establish a democratic constitution and through this the direct or indirect dominance of the proletariat direct in england where the proletarians are already a majority of the people indirect in france and germany where the majority of the people consists not only of proletarians but also of small peasants and petty bourgeois who are in the process of falling into the proletariat who are more and more dependent in all their political interests on the proletariat and who must therefore soon adapt to the demands of the proletariat perhaps this will cost a second struggle but the outcome can only be the victory of the proletariat democracy would be wholly valueless to the proletariat if it were not immediately used as a means for putting through measures directed against private property and ensuring the livelihood of the proletariat the main measures emerging as the necessary result of existing relations are the following i limitation of private property through progressive taxation heavy inheritance taxes abolition of inheritance through collateral lines brothers nephews etc forced loans etc ii gradual expropriation of landowners industrialists railroad magnates and shipowners partly through competition by state industry partly directly through compensation in the form of bonds iii confiscation of the possessions of all emigrants and rebels against the majority of the people iv organization of labor or employment of proletarians on publicly owned land in factories and workshops with competition among the workers being abolished and with the factory owners in so far as they still exist being obliged to pay the same high wages as those paid by the state v an equal obligation on all members of society to work until such time as private property has been completely abolished formation of industrial armies especially for agriculture vi centralization of money and credit in the hands of the state through a national bank with state capital and the suppression of all private banks and bankers vii increase in the number of national factories workshops railroads ships bringing new lands into cultivation and improvement of land already under cultivation  all in proportion to the growth of the capital and labor force at the disposal of the nation viii education of all children from the moment they can leave their mothers care in national establishments at national cost education and production together  draft of a communist confession of faith ix construction on public lands of great palaces as communal dwellings for associated groups of citizens engaged in both industry and agriculture and combining in their way of life the advantages of urban and rural conditions while avoiding the onesidedness and drawbacks of each x destruction of all unhealthy and jerrybuilt dwellings in urban districts xi equal inheritance rights for children born in and out of wedlock xii concentration of all means of transportation in the hands of the nation it is impossible of course to carry out all these measures at once but one will always bring others in its wake once the first radical attack on private property has been launched the proletariat will find itself forced to go ever further to concentrate increasingly in the hands of the state all capital all agriculture all transport all trade all the foregoing measures are directed to this end and they will become practicable and feasible capable of producing their centralizing effects to precisely the degree that the proletariat through its labor multiplies the countrys productive forces finally when all capital all production all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation private property will disappear of its own accord money will become superfluous and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain    will it be possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone no by creating the world market big industry has already brought all the peoples of the earth and especially the civilized peoples into such close relation with one another that none is independent of what happens to the others further it has coordinated the social development of the civilized countries to such an extent that in all of them bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes and the struggle between them the great struggle of the day it follows that the communist revolution will not merely be a national phenomenon but must take place simultaneously in all civilized countries  that is to say at least in england america france and germany it will develop in each of the these countries more or less rapidly according as one country or the other has a more developed industry greater wealth a more significant mass of productive forces hence it will go slowest and will meet most obstacles in germany most rapidly and with the fewest difficulties in england it will have a powerful impact on the other countries of the world and will radically alter the course of development which they have followed up to now while greatly stepping up its pace it is a universal revolution and will accordingly have a universal range    what will be the consequences of the ultimate disappearance of private property society will take all forces of production and means of commerce as well as the exchange and distribution of products out of the hands of private capitalists and will manage them in accordance with a plan based on the availability of resources and the needs of the whole society in this way most important of all the evil consequences which are now associated with the conduct of big industry will be abolished there will be no more crises the expanded production which for the present order of society is overproduction and hence a prevailing cause of misery will then be insufficient and in need of  draft of a communist confession of faith being expanded much further instead of generating misery overproduction will reach beyond the elementary requirements of society to assure the satisfaction of the needs of all it will create new needs and at the same time the means of satisfying them it will become the condition of and the stimulus to new progress which will no longer throw the whole social order into confusion as progress has always done in the past big industry freed from the pressure of private property will undergo such an expansion that what we now see will seem as petty in comparison as manufacture seems when put beside the big industry of our own day this development of industry will make available to society a sufficient mass of products to satisfy the needs of everyone the same will be true of agriculture which also suffers from the pressure of private property and is held back by the division of privately owned land into small parcels here existing improvements and scientific procedures will be put into practice with a resulting leap forward which will assure to society all the products it needs in this way such an abundance of goods will be able to satisfy the needs of all its members the division of society into different mutually hostile classes will then become unnecessary indeed it will be not only unnecessary but intolerable in the new social order the existence of classes originated in the division of labor and the division of labor as it has been known up to the present will completely disappear for mechanical and chemical processes are not enough to bring industrial and agricultural production up to the level we have described the capacities of the men who make use of these processes must undergo a corresponding development just as the peasants and manufacturing workers of the last century changed their whole way of life and became quite different people when they were drawn into big industry in the same way communal control over production by society as a whole and the resulting new development will both require an entirely different kind of human material people will no longer be as they are today subordinated to a single branch of production bound to it exploited by it they will no longer develop one of their faculties at the expense of all others they will no longer know only one branch or one branch of a single branch of production as a whole even industry as it is today is finding such people less and less useful industry controlled by society as a whole and operated according to a plan presupposes wellrounded human beings their faculties developed in balanced fashion able to see the system of production in its entirety the form of the division of labor which makes one a peasant another a cobbler a third a factory worker a fourth a stockmarket operator has already been undermined by machinery and will completely disappear education will enable young people quickly to familiarize themselves with the whole system of production and to pass from one branch of production to another in response to the needs of society or their own inclinations it will therefore free them from the onesided character which the presentday division of labor impresses upon every individual communist society will in this way make it possible for its members to put their comprehensively developed faculties to full use but when this happens classes will necessarily disappear it follows that society organized on a communist basis is incompatible with the existence of classes on the one hand and that the very building of such a society provides the means of abolishing class differences on the other a corollary of this is that the difference between city and country is destined to disappear the management of agriculture and industry by the same people rather than by two different classes of people is if only for purely material reasons a necessary condition of communist association the dispersal of the agricultural population on the land alongside the crowding of the industrial population into the great cities is a condition which corresponds to an undeveloped state of both agriculture and industry and can already be felt as an obstacle to further development  draft of a communist confession of faith the general cooperation of all members of society for the purpose of planned exploitation of the forces of production the expansion of production to the point where it will satisfy the needs of all the abolition of a situation in which the needs of some are satisfied at the expense of the needs of others the complete liquidation of classes and their conflicts the rounded development of the capacities of all members of society through the elimination of the present division of labor through industrial education through engaging in varying activities through the participation by all in the enjoyments produced by all through the combination of city and country  these are the main consequences of the abolition of private property    what will be the influence of communist society on the family it will transform the relations between the sexes into a purely private matter which concerns only the persons involved and into which society has no occasion to intervene it can do this since it does away with private property and educates children on a communal basis and in this way removes the two bases of traditional marriage  the dependence rooted in private property of the women on the man and of the children on the parents and here is the answer to the outcry of the highly moral philistines against the community of women community of women is a condition which belongs entirely to bourgeois society and which today finds its complete expression in prostitution but prostitution is based on private property and falls with it thus communist society instead of introducing community of women in fact abolishes it    what will be the attitude of communism to existing nationalities the nationalities of the peoples associating themselves in accordance with the principle of community will be compelled to mingle with each other as a result of this association and thereby to dissolve themselves just as the various estate and class distinctions must disappear through the abolition of their basis private property    what will be its attitude to existing religions all religions so far have been the expression of historical stages of development of individual peoples or groups of peoples but communism is the stage of historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous and brings about their disappearance     how do communists differ from socialists the socalled socialists are divided into three categories  reactionary socialists  the first category consists of adherents of a feudal and patriarchal society which has already been destroyed and is still daily being destroyed by big industry and world trade and their creation bourgeois society this category concludes from the evils of existing society that feudal and patriarchal society must be restored because it was free of such evils in one way or another all their proposals are directed to this end  draft of a communist confession of faith this category of reactionary socialists for all their seeming partisanship and their scalding tears for the misery of the proletariat is nevertheless energetically opposed by the communists for the following reasons i it strives for something which is entirely impossible ii it seeks to establish the rule of the aristocracy the guildmasters the small producers and their retinue of absolute or feudal monarchs officials soldiers and priests  a society which was to be sure free of the evils of presentday society but which brought it at least as many evils without even offering to the oppressed workers the prospect of liberation through a communist revolution iii as soon as the proletariat becomes revolutionary and communist these reactionary socialists show their true colors by immediately making common cause with the bourgeoisie against the proletarians  bourgeois socialists  the second category consists of adherents of presentday society who have been frightened for its future by the evils to which it necessarily gives rise what they want therefore is to maintain this society while getting rid of the evils which are an inherent part of it to this end some propose mere welfare measures  while others come forward with grandiose systems of reform which under the pretense of reorganizing society are in fact intended to preserve the foundations and hence the life of existing society communists must unremittingly struggle against these bourgeois socialists because they work for the enemies of communists and protect the society which communists aim to overthrow  democratic socialists  finally the third category consists of democratic socialists who favor some of the same measures the communists advocate as described in question  not as part of the transition to communism however but as measures which they believe will be sufficient to abolish the misery and evils of presentday society these democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their class or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie a class which prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures to which it gives rise has many interests in common with the proletariat it follows that in moments of action the communists will have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists and in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them  provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists it is clear that this form of cooperation in action does not exclude the discussion of differences    what is the attitude of the communists to the other political parties of our time this attitude is different in the different countries in england france and belgium where the bourgeoisie rules the communists still have a common interest with the various democratic parties an interest which is all the greater the more closely the socialistic measures they champion approach the aims of the communists  that is the more clearly and definitely they represent the interests of the proletariat and the more they depend on the proletariat for support in england for example the workingclass chartists are infinitely closer to the communists than the democratic petty bourgeoisie or the socalled radicals  draft of a communist confession of faith in america where a democratic constitution has already been established the communists must make the common cause with the party which will turn this constitution against the bourgeoisie and use it in the interests of the proletariat  that is with the agrarian national reformers  in switzerland the radicals though a very mixed party are the only group with which the communists can cooperate and among these radicals the vaudois and genevese are the most advanced in germany finally the decisive struggle now on the order of the day is that between the bourgeoisie and the absolute monarchy since the communists cannot enter upon the decisive struggle between themselves and the bourgeoisie until the bourgeoisie is in power it follows that it is in the interest of the communists to help the bourgeoisie to power as soon as possible in order the sooner to be able to overthrow it against the governments therefore the communists must continually support the radical liberal party taking care to avoid the selfdeceptions of the bourgeoisie and not fall for the enticing promises of benefits which a victory for the bourgeoisie would allegedly bring to the proletariat the sole advantages which the proletariat would derive from a bourgeois victory would consist i in various concessions which would facilitate the unification of the proletariat into a closely knit battleworthy and organized class and ii in the certainly that on the very day the absolute monarchies fall the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat will start from that day on the policy of the communists will be the same as it now is in the countries where the bourgeoisie is already in power demands of the communist party in germany demands of the communist party in germany were written by karl marx and frederick engels in paris between march  when engels arrived in paris from brussels and march   this document was discussed by members of the central authority who approved and signed it as the political programme of the communist league in the revolution that broke out in germany in march it was printed as a leaflet for distribution among revolutionary german emigrant workers who were about to return home austrian and german diplomats in paris informed their respective governments about this as early as march   and  the austrian ambassador enclosed in his letter a copy of the leaflet which he dated march  the leaflet soon reached members of the communist league in other countries in particular german emigrant workers in london early in april the demands of the communist party in germany were published in such german democratic papers as berliner zeitungshalle special supplement to no  april   dsseldorfer zeitung no  april   mannheimer abendzeitung no  april   triersche zeitung no  april   supplement deutsche allgemeine zeitung no  april   supplement and zeitung fr das deutsche volk no   april   marx and engels who left for germany round about april  and some time later settled in cologne did their best along with their followers to popularise this programme document during the revolution in  and  it was repeatedly published in the periodical press and in leaflet form not later than september   the demands were printed in cologne as a leaflet for circulation by the cologne workers association both in the town itself and in a number of districts of rhenish prussia in addition to minor stylistic changes point  in the text of the leaflet was worded differently from that published in marchapril  at the second democratic congress held in berlin in october  friedrich beust delegate from the cologne workers association spoke on behalf of the social question commission in favour of adopting a programme of action closely following the demands in november and december  various points of the demands were discussed at meetings of the cologne workers association many editions of the demands published during the revolution and after its defeat have survived to this day in their original form some of them as copies kept in the police archives at the end of  or the beginning of  an abridged version of the demands was published in pamphlet form by weller publishers in leipzig the slogan at the beginning of the document the second paragraph of point  and the last sentence of point  were omitted and the words the committee were not included among the signatories in  an abridged version of the demands was printed together with other documents of the communist league in the first part of the book die communistenverschworungen des neunzehnten jahrhunderts published in berlin for purposes of information by wermuth and stieber two police officials who staged a trial against the communists in cologne in  later engels reproduced the main points of the demands in his essay on the history of the communist league published in november  in the newspaper sozialdemokrat and as an introduction to the pamphlet k marx enthllungen ber den kommunisten prozess zu kln hottingenzrich  english translations of the demands of the

karl schapper h bauer f engels j moll w wolff the paris commune address to the international workingmens association may  the paris commune was composed by karl marx as an address to the general council of the international and included in a book the civil war in france with the aim of distributing to workers of all countries a clear understanding of the character and worldwide significance of the heroic struggle of the communards and their historical experience to learn from the book was widely circulated by  it was translated into several languages and published throughout europe and the united states the first address was delivered on july rd  five days after the beginning of the francoprussian war the second address delivered on september   gave a historical overview of the events a week after the army of bonaparte was defeated the third address delivered on may   two days after the defeat of the paris commune  detailed the significance and the underlining causes of the first workers government ever created the civil war in france was originally published by marx as only the third address only the first half of which is reproduced here in  on the th anniversary of the paris commune engels put together a new collection of the work engels decided to include the first two addresses that marx made to the international the address is included here because it can be regarded as an amendment to the manifesto clarifying a number of issues relating to the state based on the experience of the commune on the dawn of march  paris arose to the thunderburst of vive la commune what is the commune that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind the proletarians of paris said the central committee in its manifesto of march  amidst the failures and treasons of the ruling classes have understood that the hour has struck for them to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs they have understood that it is their imperious duty and their absolute right to render themselves masters of their own destinies by seizing upon the governmental power but the working class cannot simply lay hold of the readymade state machinery and wield it for its own purposes the centralized state power with its ubiquitous organs of standing army police bureaucracy clergy and judicature  organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labor  originates from the days of absolute monarchy serving nascent bourgeois society as a mighty weapon in its struggle against feudalism still its development remained clogged by all manner of medieval rubbish seignorial rights local privileges municipal and guild monopolies and provincial constitutions the gigantic broom of the french revolution of the th century swept away all these relics of bygone times thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of its last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice raised under the first empire itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old semifeudal europe against modern france during the subsequent regimes the government placed under parliamentary control  that is under the direct control of the propertied classes  became not only a hotbed of huge national debts and crushing taxes with its irresistible allurements of place pelf and patronage it became not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of the ruling classes but its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society at the same pace at which the progress of modern industry developed widened intensified the class antagonism between capital and labor the state power assumed more and more the character of the national power of capital over labor of a public force organized for social enslavement of an engine of class despotism  third address to the international working mens association may  after every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle the purely repressive character of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder relief the revolution of  resulting in the transfer of government from the landlords to the capitalists transferred it from the more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men the bourgeois republicans who in the name of the february revolution took the state power used it for the june  massacres in order to convince the working class that social republic means the republic entrusting their social subjection and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and landlord class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of government to the bourgeois republicans however after their one heroic exploit of june the bourgeois republicans had from the front to fall back to the rear of the party of order  a combination formed by all the rival fractions and factions of the appropriating classes the proper form of their jointstock government was the parliamentary republic with louis bonaparte for its president theirs was a regime of avowed class terrorism and deliberate insult towards the vile multitude if the parliamentary republic as m thiers said divided them the different fractions of the ruling class least it opened an abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside their spare ranks the restraints by which their own divisions had under former regimes still checked the state power were removed by their union and in view of the threatening upheaval of the proletariat they now used that state power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national war engine of capital against labor in their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses they were however bound not only to invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression but at the same time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold  the national assembly  one by one of all its own means of defence against the executive the executive in the person of louis bonaparte turned them out the natural offspring of the party of order republic was the second empire the empire with the coup dtat for its birth certificate universal suffrage for its sanction and the sword for its sceptre professed to rest upon the peasantry the large mass of producers not directly involved in the struggle of capital and labor it professed to save the working class by breaking down parliamentarism and with it the undisguised subserviency of government to the propertied classes it professed to save the propertied classes by upholding their economic supremacy over the working class and finally it professed to unite all classes by reviving for all the chimera of national glory in reality it was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost and the working class had not yet acquired the faculty of ruling the nation it was acclaimed throughout the world as the savior of society under its sway bourgeois society freed from political cares attained a development unexpected even by itself its industry and commerce expanded to colossal dimensions financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan orgies the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous meretricious and debased luxury the state power apparently soaring high above society and the very hotbed of all its corruptions its own rottenness and the rottenness of the society it had saved were laid bare by the bayonet of prussia herself eagerly bent upon transferring the supreme seat of that regime from paris to berlin imperialism is at the same time the most prostitute and the ultimate form of the state power which nascent bourgeois society had commenced to elaborate as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism and which fullgrown bourgeois society had finally transformed into a means for the enslavement of labor by capital the direct antithesis to the empire was the commune the cry of social republic with which the february  revolution was ushered in by the paris proletariat did but express a vague aspiration after a republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule but class rule itself the commune was the positive form of that republic  third address to the international working mens association may  paris the central seat of the old governmental power and at the same time the social stronghold of the french working class had risen in arms against the attempt of thiers and the rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire paris could resist only because in consequence of the siege it had got rid of the army and replaced it by a national guard the bulk of which consisted of working men this fact was now to be transformed into an institution the first decree of the commune therefore was the suppression of the standing army and the substitution for it of the armed people the commune was formed of the municipal councillors chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town responsible and revocable at short terms the majority of its members were naturally working men or acknowledged representatives of the working class the commune was to be a working not a parliamentary body executive and legislative at the same time instead of continuing to be the agent of the central government the police was at once stripped of its political attributes and turned into the responsible and at all times revocable agent of the commune so were the officials of all other branches of the administration from the members of the commune downwards the public service had to be done at workmans wage the vested interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves public functions ceased to be the private property of the tools of the central government not only municipal administration but the whole initiative hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands of the commune having once got rid of the standing army and the police  the physical force elements of the old government  the commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression the parsonpower by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies the priests were sent back to the recesses of private life there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in imitation of their predecessors the apostles the whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously and at the same time cleared of all interference of church and state thus not only was education made accessible to all but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force had imposed upon it the judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham independence which had but served to mask their abject subserviency to all succeeding governments to which in turn they had taken and broken the oaths of allegiance like the rest of public servants magistrates and judges were to be elective responsible and revocable the paris commune was of course to serve as a model to all the great industrial centres of france the communal regime once established in paris and the secondary centres the old centralized government would in the provinces too have to give way to the selfgovernment of the producers in a rough sketch of national organisation which the commune had no time to develop it states clearly that the commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet and that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia with an extremely short term of service the rural communities of every district were to administer their common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town and these district assemblies were again to send deputies to the national delegation in paris each delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif formal instructions of his constituents the few but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be suppressed as has been intentionally misstated but were to be discharged by communal and thereafter responsible agents the unity of the nation was not to be broken but on the contrary to be organized by communal constitution and to become a reality by the destruction of the state power which claimed to be  third address to the international working mens association may  the embodiment of that unity independent of and superior to the nation itself from which it was but a parasitic excrescence while the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority usurping preeminence over society itself and restored to the responsible agents of society instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in parliament universal suffrage was to serve the people constituted in communes as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his business and it is wellknown that companies like individuals in matters of real business generally know how to put the right man in the right place and if they for once make a mistake to redress it promptly on the other hand nothing could be more foreign to the spirit of the commune than to supercede universal suffrage by hierarchical investiture it is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterparts of older and even defunct forms of social life to which they may bear a certain likeness thus this new commune which breaks with the modern state power has been mistaken for a reproduction of the medieval communes which first preceded and afterward became the substratum of that very state power the communal constitution has been mistaken for an attempt to break up into the federation of small states as dreamt of by montesquieu and the girondins that unity of great nations which if originally brought about by political force has now become a powerful coefficient of social production the antagonism of the commune against the state power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle against overcentralization peculiar historical circumstances may have prevented the classical development as in france of the bourgeois form of government and may have allowed as in england to complete the great central state organs by corrupt vestries jobbing councillors and ferocious poorlaw guardians in the towns and virtually hereditary magistrates in the counties the communal constitution would have restored to the social body all the forces hitherto absorbed by the state parasite feeding upon and clogging the free movement of society by this one act it would have initiated the regeneration of france the provincial french bourgeois saw in the commune an attempt to restore the sway their order had held over the country under louis philippe and which under louis napoleon was supplanted by the pretended rule of the country over the towns in reality the communal constitution brought the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their districts and there secured to them in the working men the natural trustees of their interests the very existence of the commune involved as a matter of course local municipal liberty but no longer as a check upon the now superseded state power it could only enter into the head of a bismarck  who when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron always likes to resume his old trade so befitting his mental calibre of contributor to kladderadatsch the berlin punch  it could only enter into such a head to ascribe to the paris commune aspirations after the caricature of the old french municipal organization of  the prussian municipal constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary wheels in the police machinery of the prussian state the commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions  cheap government  a reality by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure the standing army and state functionarism its very existence presupposed the nonexistence of monarchy which in europe at least is the normal encumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule it supplied the republic with the basis of really democratic institutions but neither cheap government nor the true republic was its ultimate aim they were its mere concomitants the multiplicity of interpretations to which the commune has been subjected and the multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favor show that it was a thoroughly expansive political form while all the previous forms of government had been emphatically repressive its true secret was this it was essentially a working class government the product of the struggle of the  third address to the international working mens association may  producing against the appropriating class the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor except on this last condition the communal constitution would have been an impossibility and a delusion the political rule of the producer cannot coexist with the perpetuation of his social slavery the commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical foundation upon which rests the existence of classes and therefore of class rule with labor emancipated every man becomes a working man and productive labor ceases to be a class attribute it is a strange fact in spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature for the last  years about emancipation of labor no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a will than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society with its two poles of capital and wageslavery the landlord now is but the sleeping partner of the capitalist as if the capitalist society was still in its purest state of virgin innocence with its antagonisms still undeveloped with its delusions still unexploded with its prostitute realities not yet laid bare the commune they exclaim intends to abolish property the basis of all civilization yes gentlemen the commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few it aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators it wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production land and capital now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor into mere instruments of free and associated labor but this is communism impossible communism why those member of the ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system  and they are many  have become the obtrusive and fullmouthed apostles of cooperative production if cooperative production is not to remain a sham and a snare if it is to supersede the capitalist system if united cooperative societies are to regulate national production upon common plan thus taking it under their own control and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production  what else gentlemen would it be but communism possible communism the working class did not expect miracles from the commune they have no readymade utopias to introduce par decret du peuple they know that in order to work out their own emancipation and along with it that higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own economical agencies they will have to pass through long struggles through a series of historic processes transforming circumstances and men they have no ideals to realize but to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant in the full consciousness of their historic mission and with the heroic resolve to act up to it the working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the gentlemens gentlemen with pen and inkhorn and at the didactic patronage of wellwishing bourgeoisdoctrinaires pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of scientific infallibility when the paris commune took the management of the revolution in its own hands when plain working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the governmental privilege of their natural superiors and under circumstances of unexampled difficulty performed it at salaries the highest of which barely amounted to onefifth what according to high scientific authority  is the minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan schoolboard  the old world writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the red flag the symbol of the republic of labor floating over the htel de ville and yet this was the first revolution in which the working class was openly acknowledged as the only class capable of social initiative even by the great bulk of the paris bourgeois  shopkeepers tradesmen merchants  the wealthy capitalist alone excepted the commune had   professor huxley note to the german addition of   third address to the international working mens association may  saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute among the bourgeois themselves  the debtor and creditor accounts the same portion of the bourgeois after they had assisted in putting down the working mens insurrection of june  had been at once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors by the then constituent assembly but this was not their only motive for now rallying around the working class they felt there was but one alternative  the commune or the empire  under whatever name it might reappear the empire had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth by the wholesale financial swindling it fostered by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of capital and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks it had suppressed them politically it had shocked them morally by its orgies it had insulted their voltairianism by handing over the education of their children to the frres ignorantins  it had revolted their national feeling as frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the ruins it made  the disappearance of the empire in fact after the exodus from paris of the high bonapartist and capitalist boheme the true bourgeois party of order came out in the shape of the union republicaine enrolling themselves under the colors of the commune and defending it against the wilful misconstructions of thiers whether the gratitude of this great body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial time must show the commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that its victory was their only hope of all the lies hatched at versailles and reechoed by the glorious european pennyaliner one of the most tremendous was that the rurals represented the french peasantry think only of the love of the french peasant for the men to whom after  he had to pay the milliard indemnity in the eyes of the french peasant the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of  the bourgeois in  had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of  cents in the franc but then he did so in the name of the revolution while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution to shift on to the peasants shoulders the chief load of the  milliards of indemnity to be paid to the prussian the commune on the other hand in one of its first proclamations declared that the true originators of the war would be made to pay its cost the commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax  would have given him a cheap government  transformed his present bloodsuckers the notary advocate executor and other judicial vampires into salaried communal agents elected by and responsible to himself it would have freed him of the tyranny of the garde champetre the gendarme and the prefect would have put enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest and the french peasant is above all a man of reckoning he would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest instead of being extorted by the taxgatherer should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the parishioners religious instinct such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the commune  and that rule alone  held out to the french peasantry it is therefore quite superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the commune alone was able and at the same time compelled to solve in favor of the peasant  viz the hypothecary debt lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil the proltariat foncier the rural proletariat daily growing upon it and his expropriation from it enforced at a more and more rapid rate by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist farming the french peasant had elected louis bonaparte president of the republic but the party of order created the empire what the french peasant really wants he commenced to show in  and  by opposing his maire to the governments prefect his schoolmaster to the governments priest and himself to the governments gendarme all the laws made by the party of order in january and february  were avowed measures of repression against the peasant the peasant was a bonapartist because the great revolution with all its benefits to him was in his eyes personified in napoleon this delusion rapidly breaking down under the second empire and in  third address to the international working mens association may  its very nature hostile to the rurals this prejudice of the past how could it have withstood the appeal of the commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry the rurals  this was in fact their chief apprehension  knew that three months free communication of communal paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the peasants and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around paris so as to stop the spread of the rinderpest cattle pest  contagious disease if the commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of french society and therefore the truly national government it was at the same time as a working mens government as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor emphatically international within sight of that prussian army that had annexed to germany two french provinces the commune annexed to france the working people all over the world the second empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism the rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the french people even at this moment the right hand of thiers is ganessco the foul wallachian and his left hand is markovsky the russian spy the commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of dying for an immortal cause between the foreign war lost by their treason and the civil war fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader the bourgeoisie had found the time to display their patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the germans in france the commune made a german working man leo frankel its minister of labor thiers the bourgeoisie the second empire had continually deluded poland by loud professions of sympathy while in reality betraying her to and doing the dirty work of russia the commune honoured the heroic sons of poland j dabrowski and w wrblewski by placing them at the head of the defenders of paris and to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating under the eyes of the conquering prussians on one side and the bonapartist army led by bonapartist generals on the other the commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory the vendme column the great social measure of the commune was its own working existence its special measures could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers the prohibition under penalty of the employers practice to reduce wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold pretexts  a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator judge and executor and filches the money to boot another measure of this class was the surrender to associations of workmen under reserve of compensation of all closed workshops and factories no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike work the financial measures of the commune remarkable for their sagacity and moderation could only be such as were compatible with the state of a besieged town considering the colossal robberies committed upon the city of paris by the great financial companies and contractors under the protection of haussman the commune would have had an incomparably better title to confiscate their property than louis napoleon had against the orleans family the hohenzollern and the english oligarchs who both have derived a good deal of their estates from church plunders were of course greatly shocked at the commune clearing but f out of secularization while the versailles government as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength used the most violent means against the commune while it put down the free expression of opinion all over france even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns while it subjected versailles and the rest of france to an espionage far surpassing that of the second empire while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at paris and sifted all correspondence from and to paris while in the national assembly the most timid attempts to put in a word for paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the chambre introuvable of  third address to the international working mens association may   with the savage warfare of versailles outside and its attempts at corruption and conspiracy inside paris  would the commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by affecting to keep all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of profound peace had the government of the commune been akin to that of m thiers there would have been no more occasion to suppress party of order papers at paris that there was to suppress communal papers at versailles it was irritating indeed to the rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the church to be the only means of salvation for france the infidel commune unearthed the peculiar mysteries of the picpus nunnery and of the church of st laurent it was a satire upon m thiers that while he showered grand crosses upon the bonapartist generals in acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles singing capitulations and turning cigarettes at wilhelmshhe the commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were suspected of neglecting their duties the expulsion from and arrest by the commune of one of its members blanchet who had slipped in under a false name and had undergone at lyons six days imprisonment for simple bankruptcy was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger jules favre then still the foreign minister of france still selling france to bismarck and still dictating his orders to that paragon government of belgium but indeed the commune did not pretend to infallibility the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp it published its doings and sayings it initiated the public into all its shortcomings in every revolution there intrude at the side of its true agents men of different stamp some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions without insight into the present movement but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage or by the sheer force of tradition others mere brawlers who by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declarations against the government of the day have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water after march  some such men did also turn up and in some cases contrived to play preeminent parts as far as their power went they hampered the real action of the working class exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of every previous revolution they are an unavoidable evil with time they are shaken off but time was not allowed to the commune wonderful indeed was the change the commune had wrought in paris no longer any trace of the tawdry paris of the second empire no longer was paris the rendezvous of british landlords irish absentees  american exslaveholders and shoddy men russian exserfowners and wallachian boyards no more corpses at the morgue no nocturnal burglaries scarcely any robberies in fact for the first time since the days of february  the streets of paris were safe and that without any police of any kind we said a member of the commune hear no longer of assassination theft and personal assault it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to versailles all its conservative friends the cocottes had refound the scent of their protectors  the absconding men of family religion and above all of property in their stead the real women of paris showed again at the surface  heroic noble and devoted like the women of antiquity working

dead in france propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of louis bonaparte paris all truth versailles all lie and that lie vented through the mouth of thiers thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the seineetoise  you may rely upon my word which i have never broken he tells the assembly itself that it was the most freely elected and most liberal assembly france ever possessed he tells his motley soldiery that it was the admiration of the world and the finest army france ever possessed he tells the provinces that the bombardment of paris by him was a myth if some cannonshots have been fired it was not the deed of the army of versailles but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are fighting while they dare not show their faces he again tells the provinces that the artillery of versailles does not bombard paris but only cannonades it he tells the archbishop of paris that the pretended executions and reprisals  attributed to the versailles troops were all moonshine he tells paris that he was only anxious to free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it and that in fact the paris of the commune was but a handful of criminals the paris of m thiers was not the real paris of the vile multitude but a phantom paris the paris of the francsfileurs  the paris of the boulevards male and female  the rich the capitalist the gilded the idle paris now thronging with its lackeys its blacklegs its literary bohome and its cocottes at versailles saintdenis rueil and saintgermain considering the civil war but an agreeable diversion eyeing the battle going on through telescopes counting the rounds of cannon swearing by their own honour and that of their prostitutes that the performance was far better got up
