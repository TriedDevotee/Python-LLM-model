governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husbands foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease  petruchio why theres a wench come on and kiss me kate  lucentio well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat  vincentio tis a good hearing when children are toward  lucentio but a harsh hearing when women are froward  petruchio come kate well to bed we three are

mind with that which but by being so retired oerprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear  miranda your tale sir would cure deafness  prospero to have no screen between this part he playd and him he playd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor

miranda i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons  prospero now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self  miranda

sighing back again did us but loving wrong  miranda alack what trouble was i then to you  prospero o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groand which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue  miranda how came we ashore  prospero by providence

entertainer  sebastian a dollar  gonzalo dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed  sebastian you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should  gonzalo therefore my lord

 sebastian as many vouched rarities are  gonzalo that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather newdyed than stained with salt water  antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies  sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report  gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on

oer his waveworn basis bowd as stooping to relieve him i not doubt he came alive to land  alonso no no hes gone  sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banishd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief ont  alonso prithee peace  sebastian you were kneeld to and
