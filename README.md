# Python-LLM-model
Not the best model. Runs at a corss-entrophic loss of about 1.3. Has some basic web functionality cause I wanted a website for it which was fun. Apart from that, has 2 models built in, numpy and torch (for CUDA accelerated training). Continuation from my neural net. torchGenerator.py runs the model if you wanted to test it (requires torch) :)
